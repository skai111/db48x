### Coulomb’s Law & E Field

These equations describe the electrostatic force between two point charged particles and the electric field observed at the position of a test charge which replaces one of the two charges `q1` or `q2` in the expression of the electric force. A finite object carrying a net charge `q1` can be considered as a point charge if the distance to the position of the point charge `q2` is much greater than the object dimension, see example 2, for the approximate calculations of the electric force and electric field far away from a charged plate.

* **Example 1**. To calculate `[F_N;Er_N/C]` (Electric force; Electric Field) from 5 known variables:
```rpl
q1=1.6E-19_C  q2=1.6E-19_C  r=4.00E-13_cm  εr=1  qtest=1.6E-19_C
@ Expecting [ F=14.38008 28598 N Er=8.98755 17873 8⁳¹⁹ N/C ]
'ROOT(ⒺCoulomb’s Law & E Field;[F;Er];[1_N;1_N/C])'
```

* **Example 2**. A square metal plate `L = 8_cm` on a side carries a charge of `q1 = 6_μC`. Approximate values of the electric force & electric field for a point charge `q2 = 1_μC` located at `r = 3_m` can be calculated with Coulomb’s law if the separation distance is much greater than the plate dimension `r >> L`. The whole plate is indeed considered as being a point charge providing that `r > 10 · L`. Therefore, to calculate `[F_N;Er_N/C]`:
```rpl
L=8_cm r=3_m q1=6E-6_C  q2=1E-6_C  r=3_m  εr=1  qtest=1E-6_C
@ Expecting [ F=5.99170 11915 9⁳⁻³ N Er=5 991.70119 159 N/C ]
if 'r > 10*L' then
 'ROOT(ⒺCoulomb’s Law & E Field;[F;Er];[1_N;1_N/C])'
end
```

### E Field Infinite Line

The expression for the radial electric field at the distance `r` is approximately valid if this distance is such that `r << L` and therefore also applies to a wire of finite length `L`.

* To calculate `[λ_C/m;Er_N/C]` (Linear charge density; Electric Field) from 4 known variables:
```rpl
Q=5E-6_C  L=3_m  r=0.05_m  εr=1
@ Expecting [ λ=1.66666 66666 7⁳⁻⁶ C/m Er=599 170.11915 9 N/C ]
'ROOT(ⒺE Field Infinite Line;[λ;Er];[1_C/m;1_N/C])'
```
The code below saves the reference value for comparison with the example 2 in [E Field Finite Line](#E Field Finite Line):
```rpl
@ Save the reference value for comparison below
Er0=Er
```

### E Field Finite Line

The expression of the radial electric field at the distance `r` depends on the subtended angles `θ1` and `θ2` relative to the ends of the wire of finite length `L`.

![E field finite line](img/EFieldFiniteLine.bmp)

* **Example 1.** To calculate `[λ_C/m;Er_N/C]` (Electric Field; Linear charge density) from 6 known variables and also with the distance `r=(L/2)/tanθ1` and angle `θ2=360°-θ1` (see figure):
```rpl
r='(3_m)/(2*tan 30_°)' θ2='360_°-30_°'
Q=5E-6_C  L=3_m  r=2.5981_m  εr=1  θ1=30_°
@ Expecting [ λ=1.66666 66666 7⁳⁻⁶ C/m Er=5 765.46436 972 N/C ]
'ROOT(ⒺE Field Finite Line;[λ;Er];[1_C/m;1_N/C])'
```

* **Example 2.** To show that the infinite line of the previous section can approximate the finite case (if `r << L` realised when `r < L/10`), we calculate `[λ_C/m;Er_N/C]` with the angles `θ1=ATAN((L/2)/r)` and `θ2=360°-θ1` (see figure):
```rpl
Q=5E-6_C  L=3_m  r=5_cm  εr=1  θ1='atan(L/2/r)' θ2='360_°-θ1'
if 'r < L/10' then
@ Expecting [ λ=1.66666 66666 7⁳⁻⁶ C/m Er=598 837.52400 7 N/C ]
'ROOT(ⒺE Field Finite Line;[λ;Er];[1_C/m;1_N/C])'
end
```
Verify relative difference under condition `5_cm << 3_m` with the example of ([E Field Infinite Line](#E Field Infinite Line))
```rpl
Er0 Er %Ch
@ Expecting [ -5.55093 02084 6⁳⁻² ]
@ % of relative difference 
```

### E Field Infinite Plate

The expression of the perpendicular electric field is constant over an infinite plate and can approximate the field at a distance `d` from a finite plate if it is very small compare to the dimensions (length or width `L`) of the plate. On the contrary if `d >> L`, `Ep` can be approximated if we consider the whole plate as being a point charge with `q = σ·A` (where `σ` is the surface charge density), see example 2 of [Coulomb’s Law & E Field](#Coulomb’s Law & E Field).

* To calculate `[Ep_N/C;σ_C/m^2]` (Electric Field; Linear charge density) at position `[d=5_mm]` above a square plate of width `[L=8_cm]` and surface `A=L^2` where `d << L` when `d < L/10` is verified:
```rpl
L=8_cm A='L^2' d=5_mm Q=6E-6_C  A=64_cm^2  εr=1
@ Expecting [ σ=9.375⁳⁻⁸ C/cm↑2 Ep=52 941 050.0044 N/C ]

#### Straight Wire Infinite

The magnetic field expression differs depending upon whether the point at `r` is inside or outside the wire of radius `rw` and the calculations are done accordingly. The expression for the magnetic field at the distance `r` is approximately valid if the distance is such that `r << L` and therefore also applies for a wire of finite length `L` providing that `r < L/10` (see the following example 2 compared to example 2 of "Straight Wire Finite"). Note that if an electric current passes through a straight wire, one must use the following right-hand rule te determine the direction of the `B` field: when the thumb is pointed in the direction of conventional current (from positive to negative), the curled fingers will then point in the direction of the magnetic field (see fig.).


![Straight Wire Infinite](img/StraightWireInfinite.bmp)

* **Example 1.** Inside the wire, to calculate `[B_T]` (Magnetic field) from 3 known variables:
```rpl
μr=1  rw=0.25_cm  r=0.2_cm  I=25_A
@ Expecting [ B=0.0016 T ]
'ROOT(ⒺStraight Wire Infinite;[B];[1_T])'
```

* **Example 2.** Outside the wire, to calculate `[B_T]` (Magnetic field) from 3 known variables:
```rpl
μr=1  rw=0.25_cm  r=5_cm  I=25_A
@ Expecting [ B=1.⁳⁻⁴ T ]
'ROOT(ⒺStraight Wire Infinite;[B];[1_T])'
```

The code below saves the reference value for comparison with the example 2 in ([B Field Finite Wire](#B Field Finite Wire)):
```rpl
@ Save the reference value for comparison below
B0=B
```

#### Straight Wire Finite

The expression for the magnetic field at the distance `r` depends on the subtended angles `θ1` and `θ2` relative to the ends of the wire of finite length `L`. The magnetic field expression differs depending upon whether the point at `r` is inside or outside the wire of radius `rw` and the calculations are done accordingly.

![B Field From Finite Wire](img/B Field From Finite Wire.bmp)

* **Example 1.** To calculate `[B_T]` (Magnetic field) from 6 known variables:
```rpl
μr=1_1  rw=0.25_cm  r=5_cm  I=25_A  θ1=30_°  θ2=150_°
@ Expecting [ 8.66025 40378 7⁳⁻⁵ T ]
'ROOT(ⒺStraight Wire Finite;[B];[1_T])'
```

* **Example 2.** When 'r << L' which means 'r < L/10', we can verify that the value of B for a infinite wire approximates the exact value calculated for a finite wire of length 'L'.
```rpl
L=3_m  μr=1  rw=0.25_cm  r=5_cm  I=25_A  θ1='atan(r/L/2)'  θ2='180_°-θ1'
if 'r < L/10' then

#### Force Between Wires

The force between wires is positive for an attractive force (for currents having the same sign) and negative otherwise, corresponding to a repulsive force.

![Force Between Wires](img/ForceBetweenWires.bmp)

* To calculate `[Fba_N]` (Magnetic force) from 4 known variables:

'ROOT(ⒺForce Between Wires;[Fba];[1_N])'
```

#### B Field In Infinite Solenoid

The expression for the magnetic field in the center is approximately valid if the radius of the solenoid < `L` and therefore also applies inside a solenoid of finite length `L`. The right-hand rule applies also here: when the fingers curl around the solenoid in the sense of the current, the thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field (see fig.).

#### B Field In Finite Solenoid

#### Hall Effect

When a conductor carrying a current (to the right) is suddenly plunged into a perpendicular magnetic field (towards the bottom), there is a deviation (towards the top) of the free electrons which unbalances the distribution of electric charges. This transfer of charges from top to bottom gives rise to an electric force which in return balances the magnetic force. And it is precisely the appearance of this new electric field which is revealed by the Hall voltage `VH` measured between the top and the bottom of the conductor (small multimeter on the right).

#### Terminal Velocity

Terminal velocity is the maximum speed attainable by an object as it falls through a fluid like air for instance. It is reached when the sum of the increasing drag force is equal to the downward force of gravity acting on the object (neglecting buoyancy), leading to a zero net force at the resulting terminal velocity.

#### Buoyancy & Terminal Velocity

Terminal velocity is the maximum speed attainable by an object as it falls through a fluid like air for instance. It is reached when the sum of the increasing drag force plus the buoyancy is equal to the downward force of gravity acting on the object, leading to a zero net force at the resulting terminal velocity. If the terminal velocity is found to be negative, the motion is upward because buoyancy dominates gravity.

#### Malus Law

If lineraly polarized light is incident on a perfect linear polarizer the transmitted light is the component at angle `θ` between the light polarisation direction and the polarizer transmission axis. The Malus law is given in terms of light irradiances. A relavistic version of the laws applies for X rays and more energetic electromagnetic radiations (with loss up to 10% in irradiance). The decrease in frequency (`fx < fx0`) and therefore in energy (`h·fx`) of a transmitted photon is due to the movement of the interacting electron of the polarizer (Compton scattering).

#### Driven Damped Oscillations

We are considering here a damped mass-spring oscillator where the external driving force is of the form `Fdriving = Fd*cos(ω*t)` acting at the angular frequency `ω`. The corresponding differential equation : `−k*x − b*dx/dt + Fd*cos(ω*t) = m*d^2x/dt^2` describes the driven damped oscillations. When the driving frequency `ω` comes close to the natural frequency `ω0` this is the onset of resonance with amplitude increase and the total energy accumulates up to a possible catastrophy when the structure is overcome (see fig)

* To calculate `[I_kg*m^2;r_cm;V_cm^3;A_cm^2]` (Moment of inertia about `x` axis, radius, volume, area) from 3 known variables:

#### NMOS Transistor

These equations for a silicon NMOS transistor use a two-port network model. They include linear and nonlinear regions in the device characteristics and are based on a gradual-channel approximation (the electric fields in the direction of current flow are small compared to those perpendicular to the flow). The drain current and transconductance calculations differ depending on whether the transistor is in the linear, saturated, or cutoff region. The equations assume the physical geometry of the device is a rectangle, second-order length-parameter effects are negligible, shot-channel, hot-carrier, and velocity-saturation effects are negligible, and subthreshold currents are negligible.

#### Bipolar Transistors

These equations for an NPN silicon bipolar transistor are based on large-signal models developed by J.J. Ebers and J.L. Moll. The offset-voltage calculation differs depending on whether the transistor is saturated or not. The equations also include the special conditions when the emitter-base or collector-base junction is open, which are convenient for measuring transistor parameters.

#### JFETs

These equations for a silicon N-channel junction field-effect transistor (JFET) are based on the single-sided stepjunction
approximation, which assumes the gates are heavily doped compared to the channel doping,. The draincurrent
calculation differs depending on whether the gate-junction depletion-layer thickness is less than or greater
than the channel thickness. The equations assume the channel is uniformly doped and end effects (such as contact,
drain, and source resistances) are negligible.

#### Doppler Effect

In the classical Doppler effect it is assumed that the speed of the observer and the source are lower than the speed of sound in the air. The speed of the receiver relative to the air `vr` is added to the speed of sound in the air if the receiver is moving towards the source, subtracted if the receiver is moving away from the source whatever the movement of the source.

The relativistic transformations are parametrized by the real constant `v` representing a velocity confined to the x-direction. The respective inverse transformation is then parameterized by the negative of this velocity.

#### Lorentz Transformation

The primed reference frame `[xp yp zp]` is travelling with velocity `v` in the positive x direction. Therefore, the y and z coordinates of the rest frame remain unchanged.

#### Time Dilation

The dilation comes from the fact that the Lorentz factor `γ` is greater or equal to one and the proper time interval is multiplied by this factor.

#### Space Contraction

The contraction comes from the fact that the Lorentz factor `γ` is greater or equal to one and the proper space interval is divided by this factor.

#### Velocity Superposition

These expressions replace the usual Galilean addition of velocities. It can be checked that superposing with `v = c` leads to `upx = c`, hence the impossibility to superpose velocities to go beyond the velocity limit `c`. Since the velocity `v` is confined to the x-direction, the y and z components of velocity remain unchanged.

#### Acceleration Superposition

Even if the velocity `v` is confined to the x-direction, all components of the observed acceleration are transformed in the moving frame.

#### E & B Fields Transformation

#### Longitudinal Doppler Effect

#### Transverse Doppler Effect

#### Light Propagation

#### Energy & Momentum

The total relativistic energy `E` and the norm of the momentum `p` form the invariant `mo·c^2` which remains the same in all frames. The kinetic energy `K` is the difference between the total relativistic energy `E` and the rest energy `E0 = mo·c^2`.

#### Ultrarelativistic Cases

#### Gravitational Time Dilation

#### Gravitational Redshift

#### Circumnavigating Airplanes

It is assumed that the planes are circumnavigating at the same altitude `h`, same latitude `φ` and the during same flight duration `Δt` measured in the airplanes. The ground is rotating with the planet at the angular frequency `ω`. The Schwarzschild metric is taken into account. The calculation should formally invokes an integral for the elapsed proper time along a path and is approximated here to the first order in speed since the velocities of the plane and the planet surface are << `c` (slow airplanes over a slow rotating planet).

#### Clocks at different heights

It is assumed that the two clocks are at rest with respect to the ground at a latitude `φ` and are rotating with the planet at the angular frequency `ω`. The clocks are at their respective heights `h1` and `h2` for inxtance at the top and bottom of a mountain. For simplicity, the planet is assumed to have a spherical distribution. The Schwarzschild metric is taken into account. The calculation should formally invokes an integral for the elapsed proper time along a path and is approximated here to the first order in speed since the tangential velociies at height `h1` and `h2` are << `c` (slow rotating planet).

#### Planck & Wien Comparison

In this section, two comparisons are done between the Planck and Wien spectral distributiona. Based on a incomplete thermodynamic argument, the latter is an approximation of the true Planck law describing the spectral distribution for the light emitted by a black-body. The choice of temperature `T` determines the frequency ranges for integration between `f1` and `f2`, or between `f3` and `f4`. One shall determine in which frequency interval both distribution differs notably or agree. The asymptotic agreement for large frequency is clearly illustrated in the picture. The user is free to choose one or the other comparison fractions (replacing it in `Frfafb`) to compute the corresponding enissive power and the heat transfer rate from the black-body.

In this section, two comparisons are done between the Planck and Rayleigh-Jeans spectral distributiona.

The choice of temperature `T` determines the frequency ranges for integration between `f1` and `f2`, or between `f3` and `f4`. One shall determine in which frequency interval both distribution agree or differs considerably, leading to a divergence called UV catastrophy corresponding to unphysical fractions greather than one. The asymptotic agreement for small frequency is clearly illustrated in the picture. The user is free to choose one or the other comparison fractions (replacing it in `Frfafb`) to compute the corresponding enissive power and the heat transfer rate from the black-body.

#### Photoelectric Effect

Einstein explained the photoelectric effect with the energy quantification of the electromagnetic wave. The photoelectron is then emitted only if the energy `E` of the incident photon is greather or equal to the work function `φ` of the material. A simple energy budget equation determines the maximum kinetic energy `Kmax` of the photoelectron.

#### Compton Effect

In the Compton effect, both energy and momentum are conserved during the collision of the incident photon and the electron, which underlines the fact that the photon must henceforth be considered as a particle. When a high frequency `f` (or energy `E = hf`) photon scatters due to an interaction with a charged particle, there is a decrease in the energy of the photon emitted at an angle `θ` and thus, an increase in its wavelength `λp`. The energy of the ejected electron `Kmax` is relativist.

#### De Broglie Wave

At all scales where measurements have been possible, matter exhibits wave-like behavior (e.g. Young interference for protons, even for molecules). More precisely, a beam of neutron can be diffracted just like a beam of light or a water wave as it is the case in the Bragg diffraction. Here, the interference is constructive when the phase difference between the matter wave reflected off different atomic planes at an angle `θ` is a multiple of 2π, giving the Following condition: `2·d·SINθ = n·λ` with `n` integer and where `θ` is mesured between the refected waves trajectory and the atomic plane.

For all nuclear reactions, including nuclear decays, we have charge conservation `Zp = Z` and mass number conservation `Mp = M` (the same number of nucleons). This therefore requires assigning numbers A and Z to incident particles `a` and `b` whether they are for example gamma photons or neutrinos (`A = 0`, Z = 0`), positrons (`A = 0`, Z = +1`) or others. The reaction energy `Q` is always calculated with the mass-energy equivalence by the mass difference between the reactants and the products. For instance, spontaneous decays and fissions are always exothermic `Q > 0` while some nuclear reactions like can also be endothermic `Q < 0` (like nucleosynthesis of heavy elements). The mass difference should be computed with at least 8 significant digits because reactants and products masses can be of the same order of magnitude.
