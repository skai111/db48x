# Overview

## DB48X on DM42

The DB48X project intends to rebuild and improve the user experience of the
legendary HP48 family of calculators, notably their *"Reverse Polish Lisp"*
 [(RPL)](#Introduction-to-RPL)
language with its rich set of data types and built-in functions.

This project is presently targeting the **SwissMicro DM42 calculator**
and leveraging its built-in software platform, known as **DMCP**. This is
presumably the calculator you are currently running this software on.
You can also [try it in your browser](http://48calc.org).

## State of the project

This is currently **SEMI-STABLE** software, meaning that the implemented
features appear to work somewhat reliably, but that some features are still
being added with each new release. This is **NOT PRODUCTION READY** and should
not be used for any mission-critical computation.

At this point in time, you should only installing this if you are interested in
contributing to the project, whether it is in the form of code, feedback or
documentation changes. Please refer to the web site of the project on GitHub or
GitLab for details and updates. The best way to
[report an issue](https://github.com/c3d/db48x/issues),

The [implementation status](#implementation-status) section categorizes all the
RPL commands in the HP50G and in DB48X into
[implemented](#implemented-commands),
[not implemented yet](#unimplemented-commands),
[unapplicable commands](#unapplicable-commands) and
[DB48X only](#additional-commands) lists.

## Design overview

The objective is to re-create an RPL-like experience, but to optimize it for the
existing DM42 physical hardware.
Ideally, DB48X should be fully usable without a
keyboard overlay. though one is
[being worked on](https://github.com/c3d/db48x/blob/stable/Keyboard-Layout.png).

Compared to the original HP48, the DM42 has a much larger screen, but no
annunciators (it is a fully bitmap screen). It has a keyboard with dedicated
soft-menu (function) keys, but only one shift key (whereas the HP48 has two),
lacks a dedicated alpha key, does not provides left or right arrow keys (only up
and down), and has no space key (_SPC_ on the HP48).



## Keyboard interaction

The keyboard differences force us to revisit the user interaction with the
calculator compared to the HP48:

* When running DB48X on the DM42, the single yellow shift key cycles between
  three states, *Shift* (shown in the documentation as üü®), *Right Shift* (shown
  in the documentation as üü¶), and no shift.  This double-shift shortcut appears
  necessary because RPL calculators like the HP48 have a rather full keyboard
  even with two shift keys.


* A first press on the shift key is shown as üü® in the documentation, and
  activates functions shown in yellow in the keyboard overlay. A second press is
  shown as üü¶ in the documentation, and activates functions shown in blue in the
  keyboard overlay. On the screen, the shift state is indicated in the header
  area. When a [soft menu](#soft-menus) is visible on the screen, the selected
  row of functions is highlighed.

In the rest of this document, the shift key is referred to as üü®, and pressing
it twice is referred to as üü¶, irrespective of the appearance of the physical
shift key on your particular hardware. While running the firmware, this will display in the annunciator area as follows:

![Shifts](shifts.bmp)

Other aspects of the keyboard interaction are fine-tuned for RPL usage:

* Since RPL uses alphabetic entry (also called *Alpha* mode) a lot more
  frequently than on RPN models like the HP41 or HP42, making it quickly
  accessible seems important, so there are
  [three distinct ways to activate it](#alpha-mode).

* The _‚ñ≤_ and _‚ñº_ keys move the cursor *left* and *right* while editing
  instead of *up* and *down*. These cursor movements are much more useful for a
  text-based program editing as found in RPL. In the rest of this document,
  they are described as _‚óÄÔ∏é_ and _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_ respectively.

* Using üü® _‚óÄÔ∏é_ and üü® _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_ moves the cursor up and down.  When not editing, _‚óÄÔ∏é_
  and _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_ behave like _‚ñ≤_ and _‚ñº_ on the HP48, i.e. _‚óÄÔ∏é_ enters the *interactive
  stack*  and _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_ edits the object on the first level of the stack.

* Long-pressing arrow keys, the _‚Üê_ (also known as *Backspace*) or text entry
  keys in Alpha mode activates auto-repeat.

* Long-pressing keys that would directly trigger a function (e.g. _SIN_),
  including function keys associated with a soft-menu, will show up the
  [built-in help](#help) for the corresponding function.


### Alpha mode

Entering alphabetic characters is done using *Alpha* mode. These alphabetic
characters are labeled on the right of each key on the DM42's keyboard.

When *Alpha* mode is active, an _ABC_ indicator shows up in the annunciator area
at the top of the screen. For lowercase entry, the indicator changes to
_abc_.

There are three ways to enter *Alpha* mode:

* The first method is to use üü® _ENTER_ as indicated by the _ALPHA_ yellow label
  on the DM42 ENTER key. This cycles between *Alpha* _ABC_, *Lowercase* _abc_
  and *Normal* entry modes.

* The second method is to hold üü® for more than half a second. This cycles
  between *Alpha* _ABC_ and *Normal* entry modes, and cannot be used to type
  lowercase characters.

* The third method is to hold one of the arrow keys _‚óÄÔ∏é_ or _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_ *while* typing on
  the keyboard. This is called *transient alpha mode* because *Alpha* mode ends
  as soon as the arrow key is released. Using _‚óÄÔ∏é_ enters uppercase characters,
  while _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_ uses lowercase characters.

There is no equivalent of the HP48's "single-Alpha" mode. Alpha mode is either
_transient_ (when you hold one of the arrow keys) or _sticky_ (with üü® _ENTER_
or by holding üü®).

Alpha mode is cancelled when pressing _ENTER_ or _EXIT_.

Since the DM42's alphabetic keys overlap with the numeric keys (unlike the
HP48), as well as with operations such as _√ó_ and _√∑_, using üü® in Alpha mode
brings back numbers. This means üü® cannot be used for lowercase, but as
indicated above, there are two other methods to enter lowercase
characters.

Using üü® or üü¶ in combination with keys other than the numeric keypad gives a
variety of special characters. The `CharactersMenu` and `Catalog` can be used to
enter special characters in a more comfortable way.


### Key mapping

The layout of keys on DB48X was carefully chosen to offer a good compromise
between immediate applicability for calculations and giving access to numerous
advanced functions through menus.

DB48X keyboard overlays for DM-42 and DM-32 SwissMicros calculators are
[already available](https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-20113.html).

![DB48X keyboard layout](keyboard.png)

In the rest of this document, keys bindings will usually be described using the
alphabetic key, to make it easier to locate on the keyboard, followed by the
standard label on the DB48X layout. For example, the assignment for the `sin`
function will be described as _J_ (_SIN_). The shifted functions of the same key
will be described as üü® _J_ (_SIN‚Åª¬π_) or üü¶ _J_ (_HYP_) respectively.

In some cases, the label between parentheses may refer to another calculator
model, which will be indicated as follows. For example, the _A_ key can be
described as _A_ (_‚öôÔ∏è_, DM-42 _Œ£+_, DM-32 _‚àöx_).

However, if you are using DB48X on a DM42, it is possible to do it without a
keyboard overlay, because great care was taken to have the DB48X keboard layout
remain close to that of the DM42, in order to preserve muscle memory. New
features were positioned on the keyboard at positions that are close to what is
familiar in the original DM42 firmware.

A few keys that have little use in RPL are reassigned to features that you
should be able to quickly remember. For example, the DM-42 _RCL_ key is used for
the DB48X _VAR_ key, which invokes the [VariablesMenu](#VariablesMenu).

Note that the _LOG_ and _e^x_ keys are swapped relative to the DM-42. The HP42
has _LOG_ and _LN_ with shifted _10^x_ and _e^x_. DB48X has _e^x_ and _LN_
with shifted _10^X_ and _LOG_, so that the more frequently used mathematical
functions are available without shifting. Note that in the future, full
keyboard remapping similar to the HP41 or HP48 will allow you to change that
if you prefer.


Here are a few of the interesting RPL-specific key mappings:

* _A_ (_‚öôÔ∏è_, DM-42 _Œ£+_, DM-32 _‚àöx_) is used to invoke a context-sensitive
  [ToolsMenu](#ToolsMenu), which select a softkey menu based on what is on the
  stack and other context.

* üü® _A_ (_‚ÜêMENU_, DM-42 _Œ£-_, DM-32 _x¬≤_) selects the [LastMenu](#LastMenu)
  command, which displays the previously selected menu.

* üü¶ _A_ (_MAIN_, DM-32 _PARTS_) selects the [MainMenu](#MainMenu), a top-level
  menu giving indicrect access to all other menus and features in DB48X (see
  also the [Catalog](#Catalog) feature).

* _F_ (_' ()_, DM-42 _XEQ_, DM-32 _Œ£+_) opens an algebraic expression, i.e. it
  shows `''` on the command-line and switches to equation entry. If already
  inside an equation, it inserts a pair of parentheses. This can be used to
  evaluate expressions in [algebraic mode](#algebraic-mode) instead of
  RPN.

* üü® _G_ (_CPLX_, DM-42 _COMPLEX_, DM-32 _CMPLX_) lets you work with complex
  numbers. It opens the [ComplexMenu](#ComplexMenu), which can be used to enter
  complex numbers in rectangular or polar form, and perform common operations on
  these numbers. The same menu can be accessed without shift using _A_ (_‚öôÔ∏è_)
  when there is a complex number on the stack.

* _H_ (_VAR_, DM-42 and DM-32 _RCL_) opens the [VariablesMenu](#VariablesMenu)
  showing user variables in the current directory.

* _I_ (_STK_, DM-42 and DM-32 _R‚Üì_) will open the [StackMenu](#StackMenu),
  giving access to stack operations.

* üü® _I_ (_CONST_, DM-42 _œÄ_, DM-32 _HYP_) shows a
  [ConstantsMenu](#ConstantsMenu) giving access to various constants. You can
  provide your own constants in a `config/constants.csv` file on disk.

* _M_ (_X‚áÜY_) executes the RPL [Swap](#swap) function

* üü® _M_ (_LAST_, DM-42 _LAST x_, DM-32 _MEM_) is [LastArg](#LastArguments),
  which recalls the arguments of the last command.

* üü¶ _M_ (_Undo_, DM-32 _X‚áÜ_) restores the previous state of the stack. This is
  like `Last Stack` on the HP48, but on DB48X, it is a real command that can be
  used in programs.

* _N_ (_+/-_) executes the equivalent RPL `Negate` function. While editing, it
  changes the sign of the current number on the command-line.

* _O_ (_√ó10‚Åø_, _EEX_ or _E_ depending on keyboard labeling, referred to as
  _√ó10‚Åø_ in the rest of this document) is used to enter the exponent of a number
  in scientific notation. However, when not entering or editing values, it
  invokes the [Cycle](#Cycle) command, which cycles between various
  representations of a number, for example polar and rectangular for a complex
  number, or fraction and decimal for a decimal number.

* _EXIT_ (DM-32 _ON_) corresponds to what the HP48 manual calls _Attn_, and
  typically cancels the current activity. It can also be used to interrupt a
  running program.

* üü® _EXIT_ (_OFF_) shuts down the calculator. The state of the calculator is
  preserved.

* üü¶ _EXIT_ (_SAVE_) saves the current state of the calculator to disk. This
  state can be transferred to another machine, and survives system reset or
  firmware upgrades.

* üü® _0_ (_SETUP_) shows the firmware's [SystemMenu](#SystemMenu), for example
  to load the original DM-42 or DM-32 program, activate USB disk, and to access
  some calculator preferences.

* The _R/S_ keys inserts a space in the editor, an `=` sign inside equations,
 and maps to [Evaluate](#evaluate) otherwise.

* üü® _R/S_ (_¬´PROG¬ª_, DM-42 and DM-32 _PRGM_) inserts the delimiters for an RPL
  program, `¬´` and `¬ª`, while üü¶ _R/S_ (_{LIST}_) inserts the list delimiters,
  `{` and `}`.

* üü® _+_ (_CAT_, DM-42 _CATALOG_, DM-32 _LBL_) shows a complete
  context-sensitive [catalog](#Catalog) of all available functions, and
  enables auto-completion using the soft-menu keys. Note that the `+` key alone
  (without shift) activates the catalog while in *Alpha* mode. When inside text,
  the catalog presents alternates for the character at the left of the cursor,
  providing a convenient way to select diacritics and accents..

* üü¶ _+_ (_HELP_, DM-32 _RTN_) activates the context-sensitive help system.


## Soft menus

The DM42 has 6 dedicated soft-menu keys at the top of the keyboard. Most of the
advanced features of DB48X can be accessed through these soft menus. Soft menu
keys have no label on the physical calculator, but in this documentation, they
may sometimes be referred to as _F1_ through _F6_.

All built-in soft-key menus are named, with names ending in [Menu](#Menu). For
example, the [VariablesMenu](#VariablesMenu) is the menu listing global
variables in the current directory. Unlike HP RPL calculators, menus cannot be
accessed by number, but they can be accessed by name. In a future version of the
firmware, a [Menu](#Menu) special variable will return the name of the current
menu. The [LastMenu](#LastMenu) command selects the previous menu.

Menus are organized internally as a hierarchy, where menus can refer to other
menus. A special menu, [MainMenu](#MainMenu), accessible via the üü¶ _A_,
contains all other menus.

Menus can contain up to 18 entries at once, 6 being directly accessible, 6
more being shown when using the üü® key, and 6 more with üü¶. Three rows of
functions are shown on screen, with the active row highlighted.

A long press on a function key invokes the on-line help for the associated
function.

When a menu contains more than 18 entries, then the _F6_ function key turns into
a `‚ñ∂Ô∏é`, and üü® _F6_ turns into `‚óÄ`Ô∏é. These keys can be used to
navigate across the available menu entries. This replaces the _NXT_ and _PREV_
keys on HP calculators.

The [VariablesMenu](#VariablesMenu) is used to access global varibales. It is
invoked using the _H_ key, which is labeled _RCL_ on SwissMicros hardware. This
menu is special in the sense that:

* Selecting an entry *evaluates* that menu entry, for example to run a program

* The üü® function *recalls* its name without evaluating it.

* The üü¶ function *stores* into the variable.


## Differences with other RPLs

Multiple implementations of RPL exist, most of them from Hewlett-Packard.
A good reference to understand the differences between the various existing
implementations from HP is the
[HP50G Advanced User's Reference Manual](https://www.hpcalc.org/details/7141).

There are a number of intentional differences in design between DB48X and the
HP48, HP49 or HP50G's implementations of RPL. There are also a number of
unintentional differences, since the implementation is completely new.

### User interface

* DB48X features an extensive built-in help system, which you are presently
  using. Information for that help system is stored using a regular *markdown*
  file named `/help/db48x.md`, stored in the calculator's flash storage.

* DB48X features auto-completion for commands while typing, through
  the  _CAT_ key (a [catalog](#catalog) of all commands).

* Many RPL words exist in short and long form, and a user preference selects how
  a program shows. For example, the ` Negate ` command, which the HP48 calls
  ` NEG `, can display, based on [user preferences](#command-display), as
  ` NEG `, ` neg `, ` Neg ` or ` Negate `. In the help, commands are shown using
  the current spelling preference, and all possible aliases are shown on the
  right of the default spelling.

* The DB48X dialect of RPL is not case sensitive, but it is case-respecting.
  For example, if your preference is to display built-in functions in long form,
  typing ` inv ` or ` INV ` will show up as `Invert` in the resulting program.
  This means that the space of "reserved words" is larger in DB48X than in other
  RPL implementations. Notably, on HP's implementations, ` DUP ` is a keyword
  but you can use ` DuP ` as a valid variable name. This is not possible in
  DB48X.

* The saving of the stack arguments for the `LastArg` command is controled
  independently by two distinct settings, `SaveLastArguments` and
  `ProgramLastArguments`. The first one controls if `LastArg` is saved for
  interactive operations, and is enabled by default. The second one controls if
  `LastArg` is saved before executing commands while running a program or
  evaluating an expression, and is disabled by default. This impacts commands
  that evaluate programs, such as `ROOT`. On the HP48, `LastArg` after running
  `ROOT` interactively gives arguments used by some operation within `ROOT`,
  whereas on DB48X with the default settings, it returns the arguments to
  `ROOT`.

* When parsing the `Œ£` or `‚àè` functions (HP calculators only have `Œ£`), all
  arguments are separated by semi-colons like for all other functions. HP
  calculators have a special syntax in that case, where an `=` sign separates
  the index and its initial value. In other words, where an HP calculator would
  show `Œ£(i=1;10;i^2)`, which corresponds to the 4-argument sequence `i 1 10
  'i^2' Œ£`, the DB48X implementation shows and requires the `Œ£(i;1;10;i^2)`
  syntax. Note that an `=` sign may appear inside an expression, but it always
  denotes equality.


### Evaluation

* Local names are evaluated on DB48X, unlike in the HP versions of RPL. This
  makes it easier to use local subprograms in larger programs as if they were
  normal operations. In the less frequent case where you do not want evaluation,
  you need to use `RCL` like for global variables.

* Lists do not evaluate as programs by default, like on the HP28, but unlike on
  the HP48 and later HP models. This can be controlled using the
  `ListEvaluation` setting. Note that a list can be converted to a program using
  the `‚ÜíProgram` command, which makes it easy to build programs from lists.

* The `case` statement can contain `when` clauses as a shortcut for the frequent
  combination of duplicating the value and testing against a reference. For
  example, `case dup "A" = then "Alpha" end` can be replaced with
  `case "A" when "Alpha" end`.

* There are no _compiled local variables_. A program like `‚Üí ‚Üêx ¬´ Prog ¬ª`
  may perform incorrectly if `Prog` attempts to access `‚Üêx`. Compiled local
  variables are a rather obscure feature with a very limited use, and might be
  replaced with true closures (which have a well-defined meaning) if there is
  enough demand.


### Numbers

* DB48X has several separate representations for numbers:
  [integers](#integers), [fractions](#fractions),
  [decimal](#decimal-numbers) and [complex](#complex-numbers) in polar or
  rectangular form.Notably, this implementation of RPL keeps integer values
  and fractions in exact form for as long as possible to optimize both
  performance and memory usage.  This is closer to the HP50G in exact mode than
  to the HP48. Like the HP50G, DB48X will distinguish `1` (an integer) from `1.`
  (a decimal value), and the `TYPE` or `TypeName` commands will return distinct
  values.

* Integer and fraction arithmetic can be performed with arbitrary
  precision, similar to the HP50G. The `MaxNumberBits` setting controls how much
  memory can be used for integer arithmetic.

* DB48X has true fractions. From a user's perspective, this is somewhat similar
  to fractions on the HP50G, except that fractions are first-class numbers,
  whereas the HP50G treats them like expressions. On the HP50G, `1 3 / TYPE`
  returns `9.`, like for `'A + B'`. On DB48X, the `TYPE` for fractions is
  different than for expressions. Fractions can be shown either as
  `MixedFractions` or `ImproperFractions`.

* On HP50G, decimal numbers often outperform integers or fractions, and
  benchmark code will contain `1.` instead of `1` for that reason. On DB48X,
  arithmetic on integers and fractions is generally faster.

* Like the HP Prime, DB48X displays a leading zero for decimal values by
  default, whereas HP RPL calculators do not. For example, DB48x with default
  settings will display `0.5` and not `.5`. This is controlled by the
  `LeadingZero` flag.

* DB48X has two distinct representations for complex numbers, polar and
  rectangular, and transparently converts between the two formats as needed.
  The polar representation internally uses fractions of pi for the
  angle, which allows exact computations. By contrast, HP RPL implementations
  always represent complex numbers in rectangular form internally, possibly
  converting it to polar form at display time.

* DB48X features arbitrary-precision decimal floating-point. The `Precision`
  command (in the `DisplayModesMenu`) can be used to select the precision for
  numerical operations. In addition, it supports 32-bit and 64-bit
  hardware-accelerated binary floating-point.


### Representation of objects

* The storage of data in memory uses a denser format than on the HP48.
  Therefore, objects will almost always use less space on DB48X. Notably, the
  most frequently used functions and data types consume only one byte on DB48X,
  as opposed to 5 nibbles (2.5 bytes) on the HP48. A number like `123` consumes
  2 bytes on DB48X vs. 7 on the HP50 and 10.5 on the HP48.

* Numerical equality can be tested with `=`,  whereas object equality is tested
  using `==`. For example, `0=0.0` is true, but `0==0.0` is false, because `0`
  is an integer whereas `0.0` is a floating-point.

* Because of differences in internal representation that would require expensive
  computations to mimic the HP50G behaviour with limited benefit, `Size` returns
  1 for integers, algebraic expressions and unit objects.

* The `Type` command can return HP-compatible values that are sometimes
  imprecise (e.g. it cannot distinguish between polar and rectangular complex
  values), or numerical values that distinguish all the types in DB48X. This is
  controlled by the `CompatibleTypes` setting. The `TypeName` command is a
  DB48X-only extension that returns more precise textual information, and should
  be preferred both for readability and future compatibility.

* DB48X has a dedicated data type to represent multi-variate polynomials, in
  addition to the classical RPL-based algebraic expressions.


### Alignment with SwissMicros calculators

* DB48X will borrow to the DM-42 the idea of _special variables_ for settings,
  which are variables with a special meaning. For example, the `Precision`
  special variable is the current operating precision for floating point, in
  number of digits. While there is a `Precision` command that sets the value, it
  is also possible to use `'Precision' STO` to set it, and `'Precision' RCL` to
  fetch the current value. This does not imply that there is an internal
  `Precision` variable somewhere. This applies to all settings and
  flags. Additionally, binary settings can be set with `SF` and `CF`, and
  queried with `SF?` and `CF?`. For example, `'HideDate' CF` will clear the
  `HideDate` flag, meaning that the date will show in the header.

* The DB48X also provides full-screen setup menus, taking advantage of the DM42
  existing system menus. It is likely that the same menu objects used for
  softkey menus will be able to control system menus, with a different function
  to start the interaction.

* The whole banking and flash access storage mechanism of the HP48 will be
  replaced with a system that works well with FAT USB storage. It is possible to
  directly use a part of the flash storage to store RPL programs or data, either
  in source or compiled form. Using a text argument to `STO` and `RCL` accesses
  files on the USB disk, e.g. `1 "FOO.TXT" STO` stores the text representation
  of `1` in a file named `DATA/FOO.TXT` on the USB flash storage.

### List operation differences

The application of a same operation on arrays or matrices has never been very
consistent nor logical across RPL models from HP.

* On HP48 and HP50, `{1 2 3} 4 +` gives `{1 2 3 4}`. However, `{1 2 3} 4 *`
  gives a type error on the HP48 but applies the operation to list elements on
  the HP50, yielding `{4 8 12}`. Finally, `{1 2 3} 4 add` will give `{5 6 7}` on
  the HP50, but that command does not exist on HP48.

* For arrays, `[ 1 2 3 ] 4 +` fails on both the HP48 and HP50, but
  `[ 1 2 3 ] 4 *` works.

* The HP50 has a `MAP` function, which works both for list and matrices.
  `[ 1 2 3 ] ¬´ 3 + ¬ª` will return `[ 4 5 6 ]`, and `{ 1 2 3 } ¬´ 3 * ¬ª` will
  return `{ 3 6 9 }`. That function has no direct equivalent on the HP48.

DB48X considers lists as bags of items and treat them as a whole when it makes
sense, whereas arrays are focusing more on the values they contain, and will
operate on these items when it makes sense. Therefore:

* `{ 1 2 3 } 4 +` gives `{ 1 2 3 4 }`, `{ 1 2 3 } 2 -` gives `{ 1 3 }` (not yet
  implemented), and `{ 1 2 3 } 3 √ó` gives `{ 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 }`. The `√∑`
  operator is equivalent to the `ListDivide` function, and partitions a list in
  chunks of the given size and returns the number of partitions so generated
  (the last partition being possibly shorter), i.e. `{ 1 2 3 4 5 } 2 √∑` will
  generate `{1 2} {3 4} {5} 3` on the stack (this is not yet implemented).

* `[ 1 2 3 ] 4 +` gives `[ 5 6 7 ]`, `[ 1 2 3 ] 2 -` gives `[ -1 0 1 ]`,
  `[ 1 2 3 ] 3 √ó` gives `[ 3 6 9 ]` and `[ 1 2 3 ] 5 √∑` gives
  `[ 1/5 2/5 3/5 ]`.

* Two lists can be compared using lexicographic order. This also applies to the
  `Min` and `Max` functions, which compares the entire lists, whereas on HP50G,
  it compares element by element (element-wise comparison applies to arrays).

* The `|` operator to apply variables to an expression can be used without
  parentheses and chained. For example, `'A+B|A=X|B=Y+Z|Z=42'` evaluates as
  `'X+Y+42'`. This differs from the way the HP50G evaluates it, where the last
  substitution `Z=42` would not be applied since `Z` was not part of the
  original expression. In other words, on HP50G, `'A+B|(A=X;B=Y+Z;Z=42)'`
  evaluates as `'X+Y+Z'`, not as `'X+Y+42'`.The HP-style parenthesized notation
  is accepted, but is converted to the DB48X sequence of `|` form during
  parsing.


### Vectors and matrices differences

* On DB48X, vectors like `[ 1 2 3 ]` are very similar to lists. The primary
  difference is the behavior in the presence of arithmetic operators.
  On lists, addition is concatenation, e.g. `{ 1 2 3} { 4 5 6} +` is
  `{ 1 2 3 4 5 6 }`, whereas on vectors represents vector addition, e.g.
  `[1 2 3] [4 5 6] +` is `[5 7 9]`. However, unlike on the HP original
  implementation, a vector can contain any type of object, so that you can
  do `[ "ABC" "DEF" ] [ "GHI" "JKL" ] +` and obtain `[ "ABCGHI" "DEFJKL" ]`.

* Size enforcement on vectors only happens _during these operations_, not while
  you enter vectors from the command line. It is legal in DB48X to have a
  non-rectangular array like `[[1 2 3] [4 5]]`, or even an array with mixed
  objects like `[ "ABC" 3 ]`. Size or type errors on such objects may occur
  if/when arithmetic operations are performed.

* In particular, a matrix is nothing but a vector of vectors. DB48X also
  supports arrays with dimensions higher than 2, like `[[[1 2 3]]]`.

* As a consequence, The `GET` and `GETI` functions work differently on
  matrices. Consider a matrix like `[[ 7 8 9 ][ 4 5 6 ][ 1 2 3 ]]`. On the HP48,
  running `1 GET` on this object gives `7`, and the valid range of index values
  is 1 through 9. On DB48X, that object is considered as an array of vectors, so
  `1 GET` returns `[7 8 9]`.  This is intentional. The behavior of `{ 1 1 } GET`
  is identical on both platforms, and is extended to multi-dimensional arrays,
  so that `[[[4 5 6]]] { 1 1 2 } GET` returns `5`.

* Matrices and vectors can contain integer values or fractions. This is closer
  to the HP50G implementation than the HP48's. In some cases, this leads to
  different results between the implementations. If you compute the inverse of
  `[[1 2 3][4 5 6][7 8 9]` on the HP48, you get a matrix with large values, and
  the HP48 finds a small, but non-zero determinant for that matrix. The HP50G
  produces a matrix with infinities. DB48X by default produces a `Divide by
  zero` error.

* DB48X accept matrices and vectors as input to algebraic functions, and returns
  a matrix or vector with the function applied to all elements. For example,
  `[a b c] sin ` returns `[ 'sin a' 'sin b' 'sin c' ]`.

* Similarly, DB48X accept operations between a constant and a vector or matrix.
  This applies the same binary operation to all components of the vector or
  matrix. `[ a b c ] x +` returns `[ 'a+x' 'b+x' 'c+x' ]`. Consistent with that
  logic, `inv` works on vectors, and inverts each component, so that
  `[1 2 3] inv` gives `[1/1 1/2 1/3]`.

* The `Min` and `Max` operations on arrays apply element by element, in a way
  similar to how these operations apply to lists on the HP50G (which seems to
  be undocumented).


### Mathematics

* The `Œ£` operation behaves differently between the HP48 and the HP50. On the
  HP48, `I A B 'I^3' Œ£` gives an expression, `Œ£(I=A;B;I^3)`, and an empty range
  like `I 10 1 'I^3' Œ£` gives `0` as a value. On the HP50, this sum is
  simplified as a polynomial expression, so that you get a negative value if
  `A>B`. The HP50G behaviour seems surprising and undesirable. DB48X follows the
  HP48 approach.

* The `‚ÜëMatch` and `‚ÜìMatch` operations return the number of replacement
  performed, not just a binary `0` or `1` value. In addition, the patterns can
  identify specific kinds of values based on the first letter of the pattern
  variable name, e.g. `i` or `j` for positive integers, or `u` and `v` for
  unique terms, i.e. terms that are only matched once in the expression.

* When differentiating a user-defined function, HP calculators would replace `F`
  with `d1F`. The HP50G advanced reference manual suggests it should be `derF`.
  Thanks to Unicode support, DB48X will instead use `F‚Ä≤` as the name
  for the derivative function, making it closer to the standard mathematical
  notation. If `F` has multiple parameters, then the partial derivative relative
  to the first argument will be denoted as `F‚Ä≤‚ÇÅ`, the partial derivative
  relative to the second argument will be denoted as `F‚Ä≤‚ÇÇ` and so on.

* For built-in functions that have no known derivative, such as `GAMMA`, the
  HP50G would generate `d1GAMMA`, whereas DB48X will generate an
  `Unknown derivative` error.

* HP calculators would also accept `d1` for standard functions, which is only
  the name of the derivative relative to the first argument, but does not
  actually compute a partial derivative. For example, `d1SIN(2*X)` gives
  `COS(2*X)`, whereas `‚àÇX(SIN(2*X))` evaluates as `2*COS(2*X)`. DB48X does not
  recognize this `dn` notation.

* The behaviour of the HP derivative function `‚àÇ` depends on whether it is in an
  algebraic object (stepwise differentiation) or whether it is used in stack
  syntax (full differentiation). The DB48X variant always perform full
  differentiation irrespective of the syntax used.

* The _HP50G advanced reference manual_ indicates that `‚àÇ` substitutes the value
  of global variables. For example, if `Y` contains `X+3*X^2`, `'Y' 'X' ‚àÇ` is
  expected to return `1+6*X`. It actually returns `0`, unless you evaluate `Y`
  first. DB48X matches the actual behaviour of the HP50G and not the documented
  one.


### Unicode support

DB48X has almost complete support for Unicode, and stores text internally using
the UTF-8 encoding. The built-in font has minor deviations in appearance for a
few RPL-specific glyphs.

Overall, a text file produced by DB48X should appear reliably in your
favorite text editor, which should normally be GNU Emacs. This is notably the
case for state files with extension `.48S` which you can find in the `STATE`
directory on the calculator.

The `Size` operation when applying to text counts the number of Unicode
characters, not the number of bytes. The number of bytes can be computed using
the `Bytes` command.

The `Num` and `Chr` commands deal with Unicode codepoints, and do not use the
special HP characters codes. In addition, `Num` return `-1` for an empty string,
not `0`. `0` is only returned for a string that begins with a ` NUL ` codepoint.

The `Code‚ÜíChar` command can also be spelled as `Code‚ÜíText`, and take a list of
Unicode codepoints as input. Conversely, `Text‚ÜíCode` will generate a list of all
the codepoints in a text.

## Help

The DB48X project includes an extensive built-in help, which you are presently
reading. This help is stored as a `help/db48x.md` file on the calculator. You
can also read it from a web browser directly on the GitHub page of the project.

The `Help` command makes it possible to access the built-in help in a contextual
way. It is bound to üü¶ _+_. If the first level of the stack contains a text
corresponding to a valid help topic, this topic will be shown in the help
viewer. Otherwise, a help topic corresponding to the type of data in the stack
will be selected.

The DB48X help viewer works roughly similarly to the DM42's, but with history
tracking and the ability to directly access help about a given function by
holding a key for more than half a second.

To navigate the help on the calculator, use the following keys:

* The soft menu keys at the top of the keyboard, references as _F1_ through
  _F6_, correspond to the functions shown in the six labels at the bottom of the
  screen.

* While the help is shown, the keys _‚óÄÔ∏é_ and _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_ on the keyboard scroll
  through the text.

* The _F1_ key returns to the [Home](#overview) of the help file, which gives an
  overview of the project and top-down navigation links.

* The _F2_ and _F3_ keys (labels `Page‚ñ≤` and `Page‚ñº`) scroll the text one full
  page at a time.

* The _F4_ and _F5_ keys (labels `Link‚ñ≤` and `Link‚ñº`) select the previous and
  next link respectively. The keys _√∑_ and _9_ also select the previous
  link, while the keys _√ó_ and _3_ can also be used to select the next link.

* The _F6_ key correspond to the `‚ÜêMenu` label, and returns one step back in
  the help history. The _‚Üê_ key achieves the same effect.

* To follow a highlighted link, click on the _ENTER_ key.

### Hewlett and Packard

Hand-held scientific calculators changed forever when Hewlett and Packard asked
their engineers to design and produce the HP35, then again when their company
introduced the first programmable hand-held calculator with the HP65, and
finally when they introduced the RPL programming language with the HP28.

Christophe de Dinechin, the primary author of DB48X, was lucky enough to meet
both Hewlett and Packard in person, and this was a truly inspiring experience.
Launching the Silicon Valley is certainly no small achievement, but this pales
in comparison to bringing RPN and RPL to the world.


### The Maubert Team

Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a team of young students with a passion
for HP calculators began meeting on a regular basis at or around a particular
electronics shop in Paris called "Maubert Electronique", exchanging
tips about how to program the HP28 or HP48 in assembly language or where to get
precious technical documentation.

It started with Paul Courbis, who carefully reverse-engineered and documented
[the internals of RPL calculators](https://literature.hpcalc.org/items/1584),
encouraging his readers to boldly cut open these wonderful little machines
to solder IR receivers acting as makeshift PC connection tools, or to waste
countless hours debugging [video games](https://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/games).

There were more serious efforts as well, notably the
[HP48 Metakernel](https://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/apps/mk/), which completely
reinvented the HP48 user interface, making it both much faster and better.  It
is fair to see DB48X as a distant descendent from such efforts. The Metakernel
was the work of many now well-known names in the HP community, such as Cyrille
de Br√©bisson, Jean-Yves Avenard, Gerald Squelart and √âtienne de Foras. Many of
these early heroes would go on to actually change the [history of
Hewlett-Packard calculators](https://www.hpcalc.org/goodbyeaco.php) for the
better.

The original author of DB48X, Christophe de Dinechin, was part of this loose
team, focusing on [cross-development tools](https://github.com/c3d/HPDS),
which he used at the time to write several games for the HP48, notably
[PacMan](https://www.hpcalc.org/details/553) or
[Lemmings](https://www.hpcalc.org/details/530) clones. If DB48X exists, it's
largely because of that community.


### HP Museum

The [HP Museum](https://www.hpmuseum.org) not only extensively documents the
history of RPN and RPL calculators, it also provides a
[very active forum](https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/) for calculator enthusiasts
all over the world.


### HPCalc

Much of the work from [early enthusiasts](#the-maubert-team) can still be found
on [hpcalc.org](https://www.hpcalc.org) to this day.

Back in the 1990s, long before Internet was widely available, HP48 programs were
busily swapped over floppy disks, or propagated from machine to machine using
the built-in infrared ports. This may have been the first case of large-scale
viral distribution of software. This is probably the reason why all this
software. which originated from all over the world, can still be downloaded
and used today.


### newRPL project

[newRPL](https://newrpl.wiki.hpgcc3.org/doku.php) is a project initiated by
Claudio Lapilli to implement a native version of RPL, initially targeting
ARM-based HP calculators such as the HP50G.

DB48X inherits many ideas from newRPL, including, but not limited to:

* Implementing RPL natively for ARM CPUs
* Adding indicators in the cursor to indicate current status
* Integrating a [catalog](#catalog) of functions to the command line

A first iteration of DB48X started as a
[branch of newRPL](https://github.com/c3d/db48x/), although the
current implementation had to restart from scratch due to heavy space
constraints on the DM42.


### WP43 and C47 projects

The DB48X took several ideas and some inspiration from the
[WP43](https://gitlab.com/rpncalculators/wp43) and
[C47](https://47calc.com) projects.

Walter Bonin initiated the WP43 firwmare for the DM42 as a "superset of the
legendary HP42S RPN Scientific".

C47 (initially called C43) is a variant of that firmware initiated by Jaco
Mostert, which focuses on compatibility with the existing DM42, notably with
respect to keyboard layout.

DB48X borrowed at least the following from these projects:

* The very idea of writing a new firmware for the DM42
* The idea of converting standard Unicode TrueType fonts into bitmaps
  (with some additional contributions from newRPL)
* How to recompute the CRC for QSPI images so that the DM42 loads them,
  thanks to Ben Titmus
* At least some aspects of the double-shift logic and three-level menus
* The original keyboard layout template and styling, with special thanks
  to DA MacDonald.


### SwissMicros DMCP

[SwissMicros](https://www.swissmicros.com/products) offers a range of
RPN calculators that emulate well-known models from Hewlett-Packard.
This includes the [DM42](https://www.swissmicros.com/product/dm42),
which is currently the primary target for the DB48X firmware.

Special thanks and kudos to Michael Steinmann and his team for keeping
the shining spirit of HP RPN calculators alive.

# Introduction to RPL

The original RPL (*Reverse Polish Lisp*) programming language was designed and
implemented by Hewlett Packard for their calculators from the mid-1980s until
2015 (the year the HP50g was discontinued). It is based on older calculators
that used RPN (*Reverse Polish Notation*). Whereas RPN had a limited stack size of
4, RPL has a stack size only limited by memory and also incorporates
programmatic concepts from the Lisp programming language.

The first implementation of RPL accessible by the user was on the HP28C, circa
1987, which had an HP Saturn processor. More recent implementations (e.g., HP49,
HP50g) run through a Saturn emulation layer on an ARM based processor. These
ARM-based HP calculators would be good targets for a long-term port of DB48X.

DB48X is a fresh implementation of RPL on ARM, initially targetting the
SwissMicros DM42 calculator. This has [implications on the design](#design-overview)
of this particular implementation of RPL.

## The RPL stack

The RPL stack can grow arbitrarily in size.

By convention, and following RPN usage, this document gives the names `X`, `Y`,
`Z` and `T` to the first four levels of the stack. This is used to describe the
operations on the stack with synthetic stack diagrams showing the state of the
stack before and after the operation.

For example, the addition of two objects in levels 1 and 2 with the result
deposited in stack level 1 can be described in synthetic form using the
following stack diagram:

`Y` `X` ‚ñ∂ `Y+X`

The duplication operation `Duplicate` can be described in synthetic form
using the following synthetic stack diagram:

`X` ‚ñ∂ `X` `X`


## Algebraic mode

Unlike earlier RPN calculators from Hewlett-Packard, RPL calculators from HP
includes complete support for algebraic objects written using the standard
precedence rules in mathematics. This gives you the best of both worlds,
i.e. the keyboard efficiency of RPN, requiring less keystrokes for a given
operation, as well as the mathematical readability of the algebraic
notation. Better yet, it is possible and easy to build an algebraic expression
from RPN keystrokes. These nice properties are also true for DB48X.

In RPL, algebraic expressions are placed between ticks. For
example, `'2+3√ó5'` will evaluate as `17`: the multiplication `3√ó5`, giving `15`,
is performed before the addition `2+15`, which gives `17`. An algebraic
expression can also be symbolic and contain unevaluated variables. For example,
`2+x` is a valid algebraic operation. If, having this expression on the stack,
you type `3` and then hit the `√ó` key, you will end up with `(2+x)√ó3`, showing
how the algebraic expression was built from RPN keystrokes.

Algebraic expressions are not evaluated automatically. The _R/S_ key (bound to
the [Evaluate](#evaluate) function) will compute their value as needed. On the
DB48X keyboard overlay, this key is also marked as `=` for that reason.

## Rich data types

Since introducing the first scientific pocket calculator, the HP-35, in 1972,
and with it the reverse polish notation (RPN), Hewlett-Packard perfected its
line-up for decades. This led to such powerhouses pocket computers such as as
the HP-41C series, or tiny wonders of pocket efficiency such as the HP-15C. Many
of these calculators, including the models we just cited, were capable of
advanced mathematics, including dealing with complex numbers, matrix operations,
root finding or numeric integration.

Then in 1986, everything changed with the HP-28C, which introduced a new user
interface called RPL. While the most evidently visible change was an unlimited
stack, what instantly made it both more powerful and easier to use than all its
RPN predecessors was the introduction of [data types](#types). Every value
on the stack, instead of having to be a number, could be a text, a name or an
equation. This made operations completely uniform irrespective of the data being
operated on. The same `+` operation that adds numbers can also add complex
numbers, vectors, matrices, or concatenate text. The exact same logic applies in
all case. This solved a decade-long struggle to extend the capabilities of
pocket calculators.

For example, whereas the HP-41C had some support for text, with an "Alpha" mode
and an alpha register, text operations were following their own logic, with for
example `ARCL` and `ASTO` dealing with at most 6 characters at a time, because
they were artificially fitted in a register designed to hold a numerical value.
Dealing with complex numbers on the HP-41C was
[similarly clunky](https://coertvonk.com/sw/hp41/complex-arithmetic-xmem-4426).
Even the HP-15C, which had built-in support for complex numbers, remained a bit
awkward to use in "complex mode" because its display could only show one half of
a complex number, e.g. the real or imaginary part. Similarly, matrix or
statistic operations had non-obvious interactions with numbered data registers.

All this was solved with RPL, because now a complex number, a matrix or a text
would occupy a single entry on the stack. So whereas adding two integers would
require a sequence like _1_ _ENTER_ _2_ _+_ like in RPN, a very similar sequence
would add two texts: `"ABC"` _ENTER_ `"DEF"` _+_, and the exact same logic would
also add two vectors in `[1 2 3]` _ENTER_ `[4 5 6]` _+_.

DB48X adopts this extremely powerful idea, with a focus on making it as
efficient as possible for interactive calculations as well as for custom
programmed solution.
# Quickstart guide

This quickstart guide will rapidly give you an overview of the capabilities of
DB48X, and show you how to use it efficiently. Make sure that you have
[installed the latest version](#installation).

The _ON_ / _EXIT_ button is at the bottom left of the calculator. It can be used
to power the calculator on, but also to exit operations, for example aborting a
data entry.

DB48X is a RPL calculator, which means that:

* It inherits the stack-based "reverse polish" approach to operations that has
  been a central feature of practically all Hewlett-Packard scientific
  calculators since the HP-35. You enter arguments to a functions by pushing
  them on the stack, and the operation removes its arguments from the stack
  before putting its result(s). Unlike earlier HP calculators, the RPL stack is
  practically unlimited.

![Stack and menus](img/stack-and-menus.bmp)

* Unlike simpler calculators, it uses a _command line_ for data entry, with
  advanced text editing capabilities, and a rich text-based command
  language. One way to access the hundreds of available commands is by simply
  typing their name.

![Command-line and catalog](img/command-line-and-catalog.bmp)


[![Long demo of 0.7.0](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kzkjE8BZW10/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzkjE8BZW10&list=PLz1qkflzABy-Cs1R07zGB8A9K5Yjolmlf "Long demo of v0.7.0")


## Arithmetic operations

Let's compute the area of a room made of a main section that is 6 meters by 8.3
meters, with an additional smaller section that is 3.5 meters by 2.8.

A first way to do it is to use the reverse polish stack-based approach, by
typing the following sequence of keys: _6_, _ENTER_, _8_, _._, _3_, _√ó_, _3_,
_._, _5_, _ENTER_, _2_, _._, _8_, _√ó_, _+_. The result, `59.6`, shows on the
stack. Prior to pressing the _+_ key, the intermediate results for the two
multiplications, `49.8` and `9.8`, could be seen on the stack.

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/e185f3e8-dd36-4beb-a6c5-03bf489d91a7"></video>

RPL also supports the standard algebraic notation. Begin the computation with
the _'()_ key. The editor contains quotes, `''` with the cursor between
them. The cursor shows the letter `A`, indicating algebraic entry. Type _6_,
_√ó_, _8_, _._, _3_, _+_, _3_, _._, _5_, _√ó_, _2_, _._, _8_. At this point,
the text editor should show the whole expression, `'6¬∑8.3+3.5¬∑2.8'`
or `'6√ó8.3+3.5√ó2.8'`. Press `ENTER` and the expression shows up on the
stack. Hitting the _=_ / _EVAL_ / _SPC_ key (located between the _._ and _+_
keys) evaluates the expression, to get the result `59.6`.

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/ba81f9f0-ec4d-4619-bf95-c56c14210fc3"></video>

Algebraic and reverse-polish computations are equivalent, and can be mixed and
matched during computations. Using one or the other is stricly a matter of
preference. Algebraic data entry makes it easier to view the entire
expression. Reverse-polish makes it easier to see intermediate results.


## Using Fractions

Let us now compute how many pies we need to feed 22 kids if we divide each pie
in 8 slices. Using the RPL approach, we would type _2_, _2_, _ENTER_, _8_,
_√∑_. Using the algebraic notation, we would type _'()_, _2_, _2_, _√∑_, _8_,
_ENTER_ and then use the _=_ to perform the computation.

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/89ebbf7a-f331-4729-a1b9-1527287daa3e"></video>

With the default settings, you should see a mixed fraction, `2‚Åü¬≥/‚ÇÑ`. Unlike many
calculators, DB48X by default perform exact computations on fractions instead of
using approximate decimal numbers.

You can convert that fraction to a decimal value and back using the `Cycle`
command, which is bound to the _√ó10‚Åø_ key. A first press will show `2.75`, and a
second press will show the value again as fraction `2‚Åü¬≥/‚ÇÑ`.


## Mathematical functions

DB48X features a number of mathematical functions. Some of the functions are
directly available on the keyboard.

We can compute the length of the diagonal of a rectangle with sides 2m and 3m
using the Pythagorean theorem, and display it in millimeters.

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/899ad5f3-fd0b-4695-86bb-0b682a191422"></video>

In RPL, we can type the following sequence: _2_, _x¬≤_ (üü® _C_), _3_, _x¬≤_,
_+_, _‚àöx_ (_C_), _1_, _0_, _0_, _0_, _√ó_. The decimal result,
`3‚Åü605.55127‚Åü546`, is shown on the stack. The digits in the whole part of the
decimal number are grouped 3 by 3, while the digits in the fractional part are
grouped 5 by 5.

In algebraic mode, we can type the following sequence:
_'()_, _1_, _0_, _0_, _0_, _√ó_, _‚àöx_,
_2_, _x¬≤_ (üü® _C_), _+_, _3_, _x¬≤_, _ENTER_. The mathematical
expresssion shows up on the stack graphically. It can then be evaluated using
the _=_ key, and shows the same result as for RPL mode.


## Mixing algebraic and reverse-polish operations

In the algebraic expression, we have multiplied by 1000 first, whereas in the
RPL case, we multiplied by 1000 last. We can also multiply by 1000 last in
algebraic mode. There are at least two ways to do it.

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/88cb7865-87cb-427e-b18b-33086bcbabd5"></video>

A first method is to use the arrow key to exit the parentheses around the
argument of the square root function, as follows: _'()_, _‚àöx_,
_2_, _x¬≤_, _+_, _3_, _x¬≤_, _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_, _√ó_, _1_, _0_, _0_, _0_,
_ENTER_. The expression with the multiplication is then shown on the stack, and
can then be evaluated with the _=_ key.

A second method is to mix and match algebraic and RPL, by typing
the following sequence: _'()_, _‚àöx_, _2_, _x¬≤_, _+_,
_3_, _x¬≤_, _ENTER_. At this point, the expression without the
multiplication is on the stack. We can then multiply it by 1000 by typing
_1_, _0_, _0_, _0_, _√ó_. The expression with the multiplication is then shown on
the stack, and can then be evaluated with the _=_ key.


## Trigonometric functions

Consider that we need to build a plank ramp. We can ask a number of questions,
like:

* If the plank is 5 meters in length, and the slope is 10 degrees, how high
  will it reach?

* If we need to reach 60 cm above ground, what is the required slope?

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/a90b32c4-a903-4421-a768-c6b6b2afddec"></video>

In RPL, can answer the first question by typing _1_, _0_, _SIN_, _5_,
_√ó_. The result is shown in scientific format as `8.68240‚Åü88833‚Åü5√ó‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Åª¬π`.
In algebraic mode, we would type _'()_, _5_, _√ó_, _SIN_, _1_, _0_, _ENTER_
and then evaluating the expression with _=_. This shows the same result.

We can answer the second question using RPL by typing _6_, _0_, _ENTER_, _5_,
_ENTER_, _1_, _0_, _0_, _√ó_, _√∑_, _sin‚Åª¬π_ (üü® _J_). The result is shown as
`6.89210‚Åü25793‚Åü5‚Åü¬∞`. This is an example of *unit object*: the value is
associated with a unit, in that case the `¬∞` symbol indicating that we use
degrees. DB48X supports three other angle modes, radians, grads and fractions of
pi (piradians).

Answering the same question using algebraic mode introduces a new little
keyboard trick. Type _'()_,  _sin‚Åª¬π_, _6_, _0_, _√∑_, _'()_,
 _5_, _√ó_, _1_, _0_, _0_, _ENTER_, and then evaluating the expression with the
 _=_ key. Observe how the second use of the _'()_ key, which inserts parentheses
 when used inside an expression.


## Selecting display modes

The scientific notation may not be the most readable in that case. How do we
display this result with three digits? We will use a *menu* for that. Menus are
an essential component of the DB48X user interface.

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/be997041-74f9-489b-9583-b94036b9dc33"></video>

Let us type üü® _O_ (_Disp_). This shows the `DisplayModesMenu`. The menu
occupies three rows at the bottom of the screen, with six columns. Menus can
give a quick access to 18 functions directly, six more with a single shift üü®,
and yet another six with the second shift üü¶. Hitting the shift key üü®
repeatedly will highlight the different rows of the menu.

On the lower row of the menu, the second entry from the left is labeled `Fix`.
The `Fix` display mode shows a fixed number of digits after the decimal
separator. There are other modes, `Sci` to display in scientific notation, `Eng`
to display with engineering multiples (the exponent is a multiple of three), and
`Sig` to display at most a given number of digits.

We can type _3_, _F2_, where _F2_ is the second key from the left on the top row
of the keyboard. This activates the `Fix 3` mode, which shows three digits after
the decimal separator. The display changes to `0.868` for the answer to the
first question, and `6.892‚Åü¬∞` for the answer to the second question.


## Displaying the on-line help for a function

Since the number of available commands in DB48X is quite high, it is useful to
be able to consult the built-in help. In order to get help on a command, simply
hold the corresponding key until the help shows up. For instance, to get
[help about the command](#std) under the `Std` label, simply hold the _F1_ key.

This also works for normal keyboard operations. For instance, if you hold the
_SIN_ key, you will get the [help about the sine command](#sin).

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/55d312a4-3977-421e-9cdf-65d8b5ff5036"></video>

You should refer to the on-line help whenever you have a question about a
specific command.


## Angle operations

The _sin‚Åª¬π_ command we used previously returns an *angle* which was shown in
degrees, the default angle mode for DB48X. When applied to angles, the `Cycle`
command on the _√ó10‚Åø_ key cycles between various angle units: degrees, radians,
grads and pi-radians, i.e. a number of radians shown as a multiple of œÄ.

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/5d23f388-b034-45cd-9d4d-7685b7f211f0"></video>

The function also alternates between decimal and fractional representations of
angles.

In order to access angle-related functions, we can use the Tools key _‚öôÔ∏è_ which
invokes the `ToolsMenu` command. That command picks up a menu that is suited for
the value on the stack. For angles, this shows the `AnglesMenu`, which can be
used to perform angle conversions directly.

We can select the `‚ÜíDeg` command to convert an angle to degrees by hitting the
üü® _F1_ key while the `AnglesMenu` is active, and similarly for `‚ÜíRad` with
üü® _F2_, and so on. To convert the angle to a Degrees/Minutes/Seconds (DMS)
representation, we can select the `‚ÜíDMS` using the üü¶ _F1_ key, since that
function is on the second level of the menu.

There is a quick way to manually enter angles in DMS format by using the _._
more than once during data entry. For example, to enter 10¬∞20‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥, you simply
need to type _1_, _0_, _._, _2_, _0_, _._, _3_, _0_, _ENTER_.

On the command-line, this shows up as `10¬∞20‚Ä≤30_hms`. Once you hit the _ENTER_
key, this shows on the stack as `10¬∞20‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥`.

Using _._ more while on the command-line lets you add fractions of a second, for
example _1_, _0_, _._, _2_, _0_, _._, _3_, _0_, _._, _4_, _0_, _._, _5_, _0_,
_ENTER_, which will show on the stack as `10¬∞20‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥4/5`.

You can add or subtract angles directly using normal arithmetic functions. For
example, hitting the _+_ key will add angles, correctly adjusting the angle
units as necessary.


## Complex number operations

DB48X support complex numbers both in rectangular and polar (phasor) form.
For example, in our effort to build a plank ramp, we may need more than one
plank. How far and how high can you reach if you have a 5 meter plank with a
slope of 10 degrees, followed by a 3 meters plank with a slope of 30 degrees?

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/a17d5404-ad05-4a4d-8c62-069f327b3428"></video>

We can add two complex numbers in phasor form to answer that question.
In order to enter the complex number representing the first plank, we need the
`ComplexMenu`, which is activated with the _CPLX_ key (üü® _G_). The _F1_ key
will be used to enter complex numbers in rectangular form, and the _F2_ key to
enter complex numbers in polar form.

To solve our problem, we simply need to enter _CMPLX_ (üü® _G_), then _5_, _F2_,
_1_, _0_, _ENTER_ to enter the first complex number. The stack shows the complex
value as `5‚à°10¬∞`. We can enter the second complex number using _3_, _F2_, _3_,
_0_, and add the two values using the _+_ key. The result shows as
`7.522+2.368‚Öà`, which means that we can reach about 7.5 meters ahead and 2.3
meters above ground.


## Unit conversions

If you are living in the United States, having the results in meters might not
be convenient. You can use the DB48X built-in units in order to convert the
result above into feet, yards or inches.

<video src="https://github.com/c3d/db48x/assets/1695924/1fd54b22-5d1e-42bc-ac3a-2be5770422cf"></video>

Select the `UnitMenu` with üü® _5_. This shows a catalog of unit categories. We
can select the `Length` category using the _F4_ key. In order to indicate that
our result is in meters, we select the `m` unit by hitting _F1_. Our result now
shows as `7.522+2.368‚Öà‚ÄÜm` We can then convert that result in yards by selecting
the `‚Üíyd` command with the üü® _F2_ key.

You can convert to other units in the `Length` units menu the same way. This
menu is too large to fit on the screen, so the _F6_ key can be use to select the
next page in the menu with more units, such as `in` or `mm`. Note that DB48X
does not have a `NXT` key unlike HP calculators. Instead, when necessary, the
`NXT` and `PREV` features appear in the menu itself as _F6_ and üü® _F6_.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

## Installation

[![Installation process](https://img.youtube.com/vi/rVWy4N0lBOI/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVWy4N0lBOI&list=PLz1qkflzABy-Cs1R07zGB8A9K5Yjolmlf)


### Downloading the software

You can download pre-built versions of the firmware from the releases page of
the project (https://github.com/c3d/db48x/releases), or alternatively,
you can download the source code and build it yourself.

The pre-built firmware for the DM-42 is split into two components, `db48x.pgm`
and `db48x_qspi.bin`. The built-in help is stored in a file called `db48x.md`.


In addition, a file called `Demo.48s` contains a few sample RPL programs to
illustrate the capabilities of this new firmware, two comma-separated values
files `units.csv` and `constants.csv`, which define the units and constants
respectively.

### Connecting the calculator to a computer

The DM-42 calculator connects to your computer using a standard micro-USB cable.



### System menu

The `Setup` menu is displayed by using üü® _0_. This key combination is the same
on the stock DM42 firmware and on the new DB48X firmware, and it contains
similar entries. However, the setup menu entries are not necessarily in the same
order.

On the stock firmware, you need to successively select:

* `System`

* `Enter System Menu`

* `Reset to DMCP menu`

On the DB48X firmware, the required options are both directly available from the
`Setup` menu.


### Exposing internal storage as a USB disk

The `Activate USB Disk` option enables the calculator's USB disk mode, and
exposes 6MB of its internal storage as a regular flash disk that you can access
from your computer as an external disk.


### Copying DB48X installation files

The files should be copied as follows:

* `db48x.pgm` and `db48x_qspi.bin` in the root directory of the calculator's USB
  disk.

* `db48x.md` should be placed in a directory called `help`.


* `units.csv` and `constants.csv` should be placed in a directory called
  `config`. You can customize these files to add your own [units](#units) and
  [constants](#constants).


### Copying DM42 installation files

Refer to the SwissMicros installation instructions to install or reinstall the
original calculator firmware.


### Installing the DB48X QSPI file

To install the QSPI file, [select the system menu](#system-menu) and then select
the `Load QSPI from FAT` menu entry.

The `QSPI` in the menu label refers to the file ending with `_qspi.bin`. When
upgrading, you should load the new QSPI file first, and only then load the
program file.


### Installing the DB48X program file

To install the program file file, [select the system menu](#system-menu) and
then select the `Load program` menu entry.

After loading the DB48X program, the firmware loaded asks you to press a key,
and the new firmware automatically runs.


## Switching between DM42 and DB48X

Early releases of the DB48X firmware produced a QSPI image file that was capable
of running the stock DM42 program file. Unfortunately, this is no longer the
case due to space constraints.

Unfortunately, the installation procedure for the QSPI file erases the file
from the flash storage. This makes it relatively inconvenient to switch back and
forth between DB48X and original firmware, since that requires copying the
`_qspi.bin` file from your computer every time.


### Saving and restoring DB48X state

The DB48X `Setup` menu is displayed by using üü® _0_. It contains a `State` menu
entry to manage the DB48X state, which includes variables, programs and
preferences.

The `State` submenu includes the following options:

* `Load state`
* `Save state`
* `Clear state`
* `Merge state`
* `Activate USB Disk`
* `Show Disk Info`
# Types

DB48X, [like HP RPL](#rich-data-types), supports a wide variety of data types.


## Integers

The DB48X version of RPL distinguishes between integer values, like `123`, and
[decimal values](#decimal-numbers), like `123.` Integer values are represented
internally in a compact and efficient format, saving memory and making
computations faster. All values between -127 and 127 can be stored in two bytes.
All values between -16383 and 16383 in three bytes.

Integers can be [as large as memory permits](#big-integers). They represent
values in the mathematical sets known as ‚Ñï (natural numbers, i.e. positive
integers) and ‚Ñ§ (positive and negative integers).


## Big integers

The DB48X version of RPL can perform computations on arbitrarily large integers,
limited only by available memory, enabling for example the exact computation of
`100!` and making it possible to address problems that require exact integer
computations, like exploring the Syracuse conjecture.

## Fractions

Fractions represent a ratio between two integers, like `2/3`. They represent
values in the mathematical set known as ‚Ñö. In DB48X, fractions are first-class
objects, allowing exact and relatively inexpensive operations in many common
cases.


## Decimal numbers

Decimal numbers are used to represent values with a fractional part.
DB48X supports three internal representations for decimal numbers:

* Hardware accelerated 32-bit IEEE-754 with a binary representation. This is
  similar to the `float` type in a programming language like C.

* Hardware accelerated 64-bit IEEE-754 with a binary representation. This is
  similar to the `double` type in a programming language like C.

* Software variable-precision decimal representation, which is much slower.
  The default configuration selects 24 digits of precision.

Decimal numbers of various size and formats can be mixed and matched
transparently. It is valid and safe to adjust `Precision` settings along a
computation to only pay the cost of increased precision where it matters.

For example, you can compute the following expression at various precisions:

```rpl
'(SQRT(2)-1)^10-(3363-2378*SQRT(2))' DUP
512 Precision EVAL 'Precision' PURGE
@ Expecting 5.99480‚Åü35‚Å≥‚Åª‚Åµ‚Å∞‚Åπ
```

In a calculator, decimal numbers are always part of the mathematical set known
as ‚Ñö, and more precisely of a subset sometimes written as ùîª. However, they are
often improperly considered as an approximation of the set of *real* numbers, ‚Ñù.


### Variable-precision decimal

DB48X features a variable-precision decimal implementation of floating point,
like [newRPL](#newRPL-project).

The [Precision](#precision) command selects the precision for computations,
given as a number of digits.

Internally, computations are not done in base 10, but in base 1000, which allows
a more compact decimal representation. Each base-1000 "kigit" uses 10 bits in
memory. As a result:

* From a performance point of view, the cost of computations is determined by
  the `Precision` divided by 3 and rounded up to the next integer, corresponding
  to one new base-1000 kigit being added.

* From a memory point of view, `Precision` values that are multiples of 12 are
  optimal, because four base-1000 kigit require 40 bits, which line up perfectly
  with five 8-bit bytes. `Precision` values that are not multiples of 12 will
  contain a few unused bits.

The `typename` command returns `"decimal"` for variable-precision decimal
floating-point values.

When `HardwareFloatingPoint` is disabled, numerical values entered on the command
line or in a program are always stored internally with all the digits entered,
and only those. For example, if you enter a decial number with 3 digits or less,
it will only use 5 bytes:

```rpl
1.23 BYTES
@ Expecting 5
```

On the other hand, if you enter a constant with a high number of digits, then
all the digits will be preserved internally irrespective of the `Precision`
setting:

```rpl
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208
BYTES
@ Expecting 37
```

Computations are performed according to the `Precision` setting, irrespective of
the precision of input values. For example, the following computation is
guaranteed to gives `0.` irrespective of `Precision`, even if one of the inputs
to `+` has a larger number of digits stored internally:

```rpl
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208
DUP 0 SWAP - +
@ Expecting 0.
```

If desired, the larger number of digits in the user-entered constant can be
exploited by setting `Precision` before the digit-cancelling operation, as
shown below:

```rpl
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208
DUP 0 SWAP -     @ Recompute value at 24 digits
60 Precision +   @ Computation at 60 digits
'Precision' PURGE
@ Expecting 3.38327‚Åü95028‚Åü8‚Å≥‚Åª¬≤‚Å¥
```


### Binary floating-point

The 32-bit format offers a 7 digits mantissa and has a maximum exponent of 96.
The 64-bit format offers a 16 digits mantissa and has a maximum exponent of 384.

The benefits of the binary floating-point representation are:

* It delivers higher performance using hardware acceleration.
* It is compatible with the IEEE-754 representation used in most computers.
  If you need to replicate results computed by a desktop computer, this may be
  the best format to use for that reason.

The primary drawback of this representation is that it cannot represent some
decimal values exactly, in the same way as `1/3` cannot be represented exactly
in decimal. For example, `0.2` cannot be represented exactly using a binary
floating-point representation.

Using a binary format is not recommended if you need exact results on decimal
values, for example adding monetary amounts. As an illustration, if you enable
16-digit hardware binary floating-point and add `0.20` and `0.45`, the result is
`0.65000‚Åü00000‚Åü00000‚Åü022`. This is not a bug, but a limitation of the
floating-point representation. The same computation with `SoftwareFloatingPoint`
gives the exact expected result `0.65`.

The `typename` command returns `"hwfloat"` for 32-bit binary floating-point
numbers, and `"hwdouble"` for 64-bit binary floating-point numbers.

### HardwareFloatingPoint

This command enables IEEE-754 accelerated binary floating point. It is the
opposite of `SoftwareFloatingPoint`.

When this setting is active, a 32-bit IEEE-754 format is used for `Precision`
values below 7, and a 64-bit IEEE-754 format is used for `Precision` values
below 16. Variable-precision decimal computations are used for `Precision`
settings of 17 and higher.

The `HardwareFloatingPoint` setting is disabled by default because of the
inherent precision loss incurred by the binary format when dealing with decimal
numbers. For example, `0.2` cannot be represented exactly using a binary format.

### SoftwareFloatingPoint

This command disables accelerated binary floating point, and ensures that the
variable-precision decimal floating-point format is used even for `Precision`
values below 16.. This setting is the opposite of `HardwareFloatingPoint`.


## Based numbers

Based numbers are used to perform computations in any base. The most common
bases used in computer science, 2, 8, 10 and 16, have special shortcuts.
The [Bases Menu](#bases-menu) list operations on based numbers.

Like integers, based numbers can be [arbitrary large](#big-integers).
However, operations on based numbers can be truncated to a specific number of
bits using the [WordSize](#wordsize) setting. This makes it possible to perform
computations simulating a 16-bit or 256-bit processor.


## Boolean values

DB48X has two boolean values, `True` and `False`. These values are typically
returned by operations such as tests that return a truth value.

In addition, numerical values are interpreted as being `False` if the value is
0, and `True` otherwise. This applies to conditional tests, conditional loops,
and other operations that consume a truth value.

## Complex numbers

Complex numbers can be represented in rectangular form or polar form.
The rectangular form will show as something like `2+3‚Öà` on the display, where
`2` is the real part and `3` is the imaginary part. The polar form will show as
something like `1‚à°90¬∞` on the display, where `1` is the modulus and `90¬∞` is the
argument. The two forms can be mixed and matched in operations. The calculator
typically selects the most efficient form for a given operation.

Available operations on complex numbers include basic arithmetic, trigonometric,
logarithms, exponential and hyperbolic functions, as well as a few specific
functions such as [conj](#conj) or [arg](#arg). These functions are available in
the [Complex Menu](#complex-menu).


## Expressions

Algebraic expressions and equations are represented between quotes, for example
`X+1` or `A+B=C`. Many functions such as circular functions, exponential, logs
or hyperbolic functions can apply to algebraic expressions.

An expression that contains an equal sign, e.g. `sin X + 1 = cos X`, is called
an *equation*. It can be given as an argument to the solver.


## Lists

Lists are sequence of items between curly braces, such as `{ 1 'A' "Hello" }`.
They can contain an arbitrary number of elements, and can be nested.

Operations such as `sin` apply to all elements on a list.


## Vectors and matrices

Vector and matrices represent tables of numbers, and are represented between
square brackets, for example `[1 2 3]` for a vector and `[[1 2] [3 4]` for a 2x2
matrix.

Vector and matrices follow their own arithmetic rules. Vectors are
one-dimensional, matrices are two-dimensional. DB48X also supports tables with a
higher number of dimensions, but only offers limited operations on them.

DB48X implements vector addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
which apply component-wise. Multiplication and division are an extension
compared to the HP48.

DB48X also implements matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division. Like on the HP48, the division of matrix `A` by matrix `B` is
interpreted as left-multiplying `A` by the inverse of `B`.

As another extension, algebraic functions such as `sin` apply to all elements in
a vector or matrix in turn.


## Units

Unit objects represent values with an associated unit. They are represented
using the `_` operator, e.g. `1_km/s`, although on display this operator is
shown as a thin space, e.g. `1‚ÄÑkm/s`.

Units as implemented in DB48X are modernized compared to what the HP48
implements, and differ from the HP RPL implementation in the following ways:

* Add [recent SI prefixes](https://www.nist.gov/pml/owm/metric-si-prefixes),
  Z (zetta), Y (yotta), R (ronna) and Q (quetta) for large scale,
  z (zepto), y (yocto), r (ronto) and q (quecto) for small scale.

* Take into account the impact on unit conversions of the
  [revised 2023 definition of the foot](https://www.nist.gov/pml/us-surveyfoot/revised-unit-conversion-factors).

* Use exact (fraction-based) conversions wherever possible. This notably matters
  for the conversions of pre-2023 US Survey units, where the ratio is
  `1_ft = 1200/3937_m`, which is not well represented using decimal values.

* Add computer-related units, like the `byte`, the `bit`, the `baud`, as well
  as a menu supporting these units.

* In order to support the computer-related units better, also recognize the
  [power-of-two variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte),
  e.g. `1_kiB` is `1024_B`. Also recogize the `K` prefix in addition to `k`.

### Units file

The built-in units can be overriden by your own set of units, which is defined
in a CSV file called `config/units.csv` in the calculator. CSV stands for "Comma
separated values, and is a common interchange format for spreadsheet data.

Here is an example of file that would let you have a units menu called `Money`
to convert between various monetary units:

```
"Money"
"USD", "1_USD"
"EUR", "1.07_USD"
"GBP", "1.24_USD"
"CAD", "0.73_USD"
"AUD", "0.65_USD"
"CHF", "1.11_USD"
```

* All values must be placed between quotes. Separators between text values are
  mostly ignored.

* Rows in a file containing a single value denote unit menus, unless the value
  begins with an `=` sign.

* Rows in a file containing two ore more values denote unit menu entries, which
  will be added to the previous menu.

* The first column in these rows give the name of the unit as shown in the menu.

* The second column in these rows gives the definition of the unit.

* The definition should be reduced to `=` if the first column contains what
  would be a valid unit expression. For example, to place `km/h` in a menu, use
  `"km/h", "="` since `km` can be deduced from existing unit `m` using the
  standard "kilo" unit prefix, and `h` is an existing unit.

A unit where the value is `1` of the same unit is a base unit. This is the case
for `USD` in the example above, which is considered the base units for monetary
exchanges. Units that refer to the same base unit can be converted with one
another. For example, you can convert between `GBP` and `AUD` because they both
have the same `USD` base unit.

The commands `ShowBuiltinUnits` and `HideBuiltinUnits` indicate if the built-in
uits should be shown after the units loaded from the file. The default is that
when a units file is present, the built-in units are hidden. This only affects
the menus. Built-in units can always be used in expressions if they are typed
manually. However, units loaded from file will be looked up first, so that a
built-in unit can be overriden by the units file, which can be useful if a
definition changes like the US Survey foot changed on January 1st, 2023.

If you build a units file, it is recommended that you do not exceed 17 unit
submenus so that all unit categories fit on a single screen.


### Cycle command customization

The menu name `"=Cycle"` is reserved to define sequences of units that the
`Cycle` command (bound to the _√ó10‚Åø_ key) will recognize as special. For
example, you can ensure that `mm` and `in` convert to one another as follows:

```
"=Cycle"
"in", "mm"
"mm", "in"
"USD", "EUR"
"EUR", "CHF"
"CHF", "USD"
```

If you do provide a `Cycle` customization for a unit, other normal behaviours of
the `Cycle` command for units are disabled, notably conversion between various
relevant scales and conversion between fractions and decimal. To force a
particular conversion to happen in decimal, you can override the definition of
the corresponding unit in the units file, for example:

```
"in",   "25.4_mm"
```


## Constants

Constant objects represent named values like Euler's constant `e`, the ratio
between circumference and diameter of a circle `œÄ`, or the speed of light `c`.
They are represented by a name, and have an associated value.

Like units, there are some built-in constants, and additional constants can be
provided by a `config/constants.csv` file, which has the same format as
for the units file.

On the command-line, constant names are prefixed with _CST_, which is a way to
distinguish them from normal symbols.

You can edit the constants catalog by recalling its content on the stack using
`"config:equations.csv" RCL`, editing the values, and then storing the content
back to disk using `"config:equations.csv" STO`.


## Infinite results

Some operations such as `1/0` or `tan 90‚ÄÜ¬∞` are said to produce an
*infinite result*. Like HP calculators, DB48X can either generate an error or
produce a special result in these cases.

* If the `InfinityValue` (-22) flag is clear, corresponding to the
  `InfinityError` setting, then the operation generates a
  `Division by zero` error. Note that the text of the error is different than
  for Hewlett-Packard calculators, which generate an `Infinite result` error.

* If the `InfinityValue` flag is set and `NumericalConstants` (-2) flag
  is clear, corresponding to the `SymbolicConstants` setting, then the operation
  generates the `‚àû` (infinity) constant with the appropriate sign for the
  result, and the `InfiniteResultIndicator` (-26) flag is set.

* If the `InfinityValue` flag is set and `NumericalConstants` flag is set,
  then the operation generates the numerical value associated to the `‚àû`
  constant with the appropriate sign for the result, and set the
  `InfiniteResultIndicator` flag.

By default, the numerical value of the `‚àû` constant is set to `9.99999E999999`,
which is significantly smaller than what would actually cause a numerical
[overflow](#overflow-and-underflow), but is easy to read. This value can be
changed in the `config/constants.csv` file.


## Overflow and underflow

There is a maximum representable value for [decimal numbers](#decimal-numbers).
This value is significantly larger than on HP calculators. Whereas HP RPL
implementations could not represent decimal numbers with an exponent bigger than
499 or smaller than -499, DB48X supports exponents ranging from -2^60 to 2^60
(¬±1‚ÄØ152‚ÄØ921‚ÄØ504‚ÄØ606‚ÄØ846‚ÄØ976).

An *overflow* happens if the result would have an exponent higher than the
maximum. An *underflow* happens if the result would have an exponent lower than
the minimum. Like HP calculators, DB48X can either generate an error or
produce a special result in these cases.

* If the `UnderflowValue` (-20) or `OverflowValue` (-21) is clear,
  corresponding to the `UnderflowError` or `OverflowError`
  setting, then the operation generates a `Positive numerical underflow`,
  `Negative numerical underflow` or `Numerical overflow` error depending on the
  computation. Note that the text of the error is different than for
  Hewlett-Packard calculators, which generate an `Overflow`, `Positive
  Underflow` or `Negative Underflow` error.

* If the `UnderflowValue` or `OverflowValue` is set,
  and `NumericalConstants` (-2) flag is clear, corresponding to the
  `SymbolicConstants` setting, then overflowing operations generate the `‚àû`
  (infinity) constant with the appropriate sign for the result, and underflowing
  operations generate a zero value. The operation also sets the
  `NegativeUnderflowIndicator` (-23), `PositiveOverflowIndicator` (-24) or
  `OverflowIndicator` (-25) flag.

* If the `UnderflowValue` or `OverflowValue` is set, and
  `NumericalConstants` flag is set, then overflowing operations generate the
  numerical value associated to the  `‚àû` constant, and underflowing operations
  generate a zero value. The operation also sets the
  `NegativeUnderflowIndicator` (-23), `PositiveOverflowIndicator` (-24) or
  `OverflowIndicator` (-25) flag.


## Undefined

Some operations such as `0/0` are *undefined*, meaning that there isn't a single
possible answer.

If the `UndefinedValue` flag is set, such operations return the constant
`?`, and further operations on the value will keep returning the same undefined
result.

If the `UndefinedValue` flag is is clear, which corresponds to `UndefinedError`
being set, such operations will generate an `Undefined operation` error.


## Library

The `Library` is a catalog of frequently used and rarely modified objects that
are stored on disk in the `config/library.csv` file.

You can edit it by recalling its content on the stack using
`"config:library.csv" RCL`, editing the values, and then storing the content
back to disk using `"config:library.csv" STO`.


## Equations Library

The equations library is a catalog of common equations that are stored on disk
in the `config/equations.csv` file.

You can edit it by recalling its content on the stack using
`"config:equations.csv" RCL`, editing the values, and then storing the content
back to disk using `"config:equations.csv" STO`.
# Release notes

## Release 0.8.6 "Daniel" - Bug fixes and optimizations

This release is mostly intended to fix a number of issues reported by
users or discovered during testing.

### Features

* Fancy digits are now accepted for decimal and based numbers.
  This means that `1.‚Å≥¬≥¬≤` is now a valid input to `Str‚Üí`, ensuring
  that we can parse the output of `‚ÜíStr` if it uses fancy characters,
  or that copy-paste works from the stack to the editor.
* Accept array arguments for `min` and `max`, applied element-wise in
  the same way as addition for example.
* Add `CompatibleBasedNumbers` setting to render `16#AB` as `#ABh`
  like HP calculators.
* Improve protection against mismatched QSPI and PGM. Only binaries
  issued from the same build are now accepted. This is mostly of
  interest to developers, although releases that are very close to one
  another, like v0.8.4 and v0.8.5 were, can require this protection.
* On DM32, numbers with an explicit numerical base keep that base if
  it's 16, 10, 8 or 2. For example, `10#200` and `#200‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ` will display in
  base 10 irrespective of the `Base` setting, just like `#200d`.
* Add `œµ` character (Greek Lunate epsilon), which appears in some
  equations.
* Add text alignment options to `DrawText`, making it possible to
  align text horizontally or vertically. See examples at end of the
  `Texts` program in `Demo.48s`
* Add `UnitsSIPrefixCycle` command to set the variable with the same
  name to customize SI prefixes cycling for units on the command-line.
  After `"KMG" UnitsSIPrefixCycle`, typing the `Cycle` key (__√ó10‚Åø_ or
  _EEX_) with `1_B` will cycle through `1_KB`, `1_MB`, `1_GB` and back
  to `1_B`.
* Accept `u` as an alternative SI prefix for "micro-", e.g. `1_us`.
  This is intended to allow entering of the "micro" prefix using
  transient alpha mode.
* Add help lookup for solver variables. When in the `SolverMenu`,
  holding the function key for a vairable brings up the help for the
  corresponding variable in the equations library.
* Add `SiDensity` (`SIDENS` on HP) and `Fanning` functions to the
  library. These functions are used by some equations in the library.
* Add `invert` alias for 1/x operation (like `negate` for `neg`).


### Bug fixes

* Fix unit scale cycling for multi-character units
* Fix incorrect computation of output matrix size for non-square
  matrices. `[[1 2]][[3 4]] +` now works.
* Negation on based numbers and polynomials now works.
* Conversion of decimal values smaller than 1.0 to integer no longer
  crashes (this could only happen with the `RanM` command)
* Render `-` for first term of polynonials if negative
* On DM42, update the bases menu when cycling based numbers
* Fix parameter mixup for call to `program::run`. In theory, this
  could lead to programs not evaluating correctly if `NoLastArguments`
  setting was set, although another bug apparently made this very
  unlikely to be observed.
* Update index footer to point to `https://48calc.org` instead of
  obsolete `https://github.io` location.
* Updating a `for` loop variable from within the loop now behaves like
  on HP calculators, and can be used to control loop exit.
* Do not draw activity indicator in graphical mode. This was a
  regression introduced with `BusyIndicatorRefresh`.
* Mark `xroot` command as implemented in the `PowersMenu`
* Use consistent case for variable `x` in the equations library
* Do not error out comparing text values
* doc: Fix typo `latter` -> `letter`


### Improvements

* Add auto-cleaner optimizations for matrix and vector operations.
  This reduces the memory usage and frequency of garbage collections.
* Reduce `random` bias for integer input, e.g. `-10 10 random` no
  longer has a +0.5 bias on average.
* doc: Several updates and fixes to the documentation, notably with
  respect to the description of the current status, and instructions
  for Windows developers.
* Add `‚ÜíPrg` alias for `‚ÜíProgram`
* Add the simulator minimum window size
* Add `rmdir` as an alias for `pgdir`. "This is Unix".
* Add `L` (uppercase) spelling for "liter" unit
* doc: Avoid overlapping aliases in `Rcl/` help text by adding some
  aditional text to the `Rcl*` help.
* doc: Add documentation for `SolverMenuSolve` and `SolverMenuRecall`
* doc: Fix documentation for `AssignKey`
* doc: Add documentation for comparisons
* doc: Remove duplicate `dup`
* doc: Update documentation about `add`
* doc: Refer to `CharactersMenu` and `Catalog` in alpha overview
* doc: Update keyboard sequences typography
* doc: Remove false claim that interactive stack is not implemented
* doc: Update implemented / unimplemented list


## Release 0.8.5 "Stone" - Emergency keyboard fixups

The major changes in 0.8.4 caused some damage to keyboard handling
code that require a few emergency fixes.

### Bug fixes

* Fix incorrect selection of lowercase characters

* Fix the location of `exp` and `log10` in `42style` and `true42`
  keymaps.

* Do not enter interactive stack if reaching leftmost position of the
  text editor.


## Release 0.8.4 "Commands" - Optimizations and equation fixups

This release focuses on improving the solver support for the equation
library, fixing various bugs found during development of that equation
library, and optimizing the garbage collector.

### Features

* ui: The keyboard layout is now configured by a a `config/[keymap].48k`
  file that describes which commands are assigned to which key by
  default. A new setup entry, `Load keymap`, lets you change the
  keyboard layout.

* ui: Add four predefined keyboard layouts:

  * `db48x.48k` is a key layout that is more logical and effective for DB48x
    [See thread](https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-20157-post-193647.html#pid193647)
  * `legacy.48k` is the layout used for earlier releases, which
    swaps the `exp` and `log10` keys relative to the DM42 in `42style.48k`.
  * `42style.48k` keeps key layout as close as possible to the DM42
  * `true42.48k` is identical to `42style.48k`, but the simulator shows an image
    of the DM42 keyboard.

* Add various commands such as `Edit` to directly perform editing
  operations in a programmatic way.

* units: Implement non-proportional unit conversions, notably
  temperature conversions like `¬∞F` to `¬∞C`. The underlying engine
  allows arbitrary conversions, including non-linear ones, which would
  be useful for example for the Dalton temperature scale. However,
  that capability is not presently used.

* units: Convert temperatures to `K` in multiplication and
  division. For example, when computing `‚í∏R*T`, we need the
  temperature `T` to be in `K` even if given in Celsius or Farenheit
  initially.

* solver: Report underlying evaluation error. For example, if the
  expression being evaluated reports `Inconsistent units`, this is
  what the solver will return instead of `No solution?`.

* ui: Add configurable interval for busy cursor drawing,
  `BusyIndicatorRefresh`.  The default is now 50ms, which refreshes
  the busy cursor more frequently than before, and may be detrimental
  to battery life and performance. You can restore the previous
  behaviour by setting a higher value, e.g. 1000ms.

* performance: Automatic cleanup of temporaries to minimize the number
  of garbage collection occurences. When a complex operation such as
  `exp` is performed, there are a number of intermediate results that
  require storage, and were previously only cleaned up by the garbage
  collector. They are now automatically cleaned up before the function
  returns. The same optimization applies to intermediate graphics
  while rendering equations, notably on the stack. This delivers
  [significant performance improvements](#garbage-collector-performance)
  for long-running operations:
  the "[floating-point sum test](https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-9750.html)
  is now about 20% faster on SwissMicros calculators.

* commands: Add `GCStats` command to show garbage collector statistics.

* Allow `CustomMenu` to contain the name of a menu, or a program that
  builds the menu dynamically. An example is shown in the `RPL`
  directory of the Demo file.

* Allow `CustomMenu` to define "vertical" menus, i.e. menus where the
  items are stacked on top of one another.

### Bug fixes

* Fix functions taking real-like unit input. For example,
  `atan(1_cm/1_m)` now computes correctly.

* solver: Do not solve system of equations using existing values. The
  multiple equation solver would incorrectly consider existing values
  in variables to check if an equation could be used for solving. The
  heuristic now picks up the equation that requires the smallest
  number of unknown variables among the available equations.

* Parse `x!` as factorial of `x` and not as a `x!` symbol. The
  incorrect parsing was due to an ambiguity in the HP48 parser that
  was resolved in the HP50G. DB48X now behaves like the HP50G and does
  not allow `!` to appear at the end of a name.

* Do not enter the debugger if `DebugOnError` is set while evaluating
  an `iferr` statement. The assumption is that if you try to catch an
  error, you do not intend to debug the code being tested for an
  error. If this is not the desired behaviour, then an explicit
  `DebugOnError` should be inserted in the body of `iferr`.

* Various unit-related fixes in the equation library.

* Ensure that we don't execute auto-completed catalog commands
  twice. The recent change that added the auto-completed command to
  the command-line history also caused the command to be executed on
  the command-line before being evaluated again from the key.

* Avoid a rare crash when an equation was too big to be rendered
  graphically and a garbage collection cycle occured between graphic
  rendering and text rendering.

* Do not emit error message from `Vec‚Üí` for vectors containing
  units. The incorrect error was introduced by the logic detecting
  polar, cylindrical or spherical vectors.

* Fixed `atan2` special cases to always generate the correct
  angle. Cases where `atan2` would generate an exact result would
  usually result in the wrong angle unit scaling being applied.

* Fixed parsing of `tan‚Åª¬π` in expressions.

* units: Skip the `=Cycle` section for unit definitions. This was
  causing incorrect unit conversion errors for users who had added
  common units in the `=Cycle` section of their `config/units.csv`
  file.

* The user-defined units menu no longer list all the built-in units
  after the user-defined ones.

* Add a missing `sqrt` in the `RelativisticKineticEnergy` sample code,
  and do not compute the kinetic energies for negative values.

* Alias `keys` is for `KeyMap`, not `Header`. Fix typo in identifiers
  table.

* Avoid a crash in `RandomMatrix` when hardware floating-point is
  enabled, due to an incorrect conversion to integer. As a side
  effect, fixed a couple of minor issues in the conversion to integer
  values from decimal or binary floating-point values.

* Fix bogus `Bad argument type` message for `V‚Üí` when the number of
  elements was not 2 or 3.

* Fix crash when dividing a matrix by a non-invertible matrix.

* Fix crash displaying non-normal hardware floating-point values.

* Fix crash in vector operations that cause errors, e.g. `[1][0] /`.

* Parse `ubase` algebraic expressions, e.g. `ubase(1_km)`, as well
  as other function-like commands such as `size`.

* Accept numerical values in `ubase` and leave them as is.

* Adjust the "next step" computation in the solver to minimize the
  complexity of conversions and remove unit ambiguity for temperatures.

* Rewrite the Heat Transfer equations to clarify temperature unit used
  in the computation. Specifically, avoid having a `ŒîT` in a
  multiplication, where the value would be incorrectly converted to
  `K`.

* Fix a problem when a garbage collection while parsing a fraction
  could cause a large fraction of the subsequent program to be
  skipped. This normally led to anomalous `Inconsistent units`
  messages when this caused a unit such as `254/10_mm` for `in` to be
  incorrectly parsed as `254/10`.


### Enhancements

* Major update to the documentation of the equation library,
  contributed by Jean Wilson.
* equations: Replace `¬∞F` with `¬∞C` in equations
* tests: Add support for tests that are known to fail
* tests: Run equation tests with `11 DIG`
* tests: Add ability to take screen snapshots on failure
* units: Put temperatures before pressure in `Fluids` section
* help: Add image for B Field From Finite Wire
* Makefile: When using `make update`, do not keep the temporary `.png`
* Indicate where to get `tac` in the build documentation
* Fix README link to browser version
* Disable `DebugOnError` by default, since it confused new users
* Enhance the test suite so that it looks up the keys to use.
  This makes the test suite more readable, e.g. we have `ID_exp` in
  the test instead of `D` (the `D` key being where `exp` was on the
  original layout), and it makes the test suite layout-independent,
  paving the way for reuse on other hardware (e.g. HP50G).


## Release 0.8.3 "Blindness" - User mode and custom header

This release focuses on various user interface aspects.

### Features

* User mode, key assignment, `ASN`, `STOKEYS`, `RCLKEYS`, `DELKEYS`. Unlike HP
  calculators, key assignments are per directory, with inner directories
  inheriting the key assignments from the enclosing directories.
* Add `Header` command to customize the header. For example, you can now show
  the path in the header, or any relevant information. This customization can be
  done per-directory.
* Implement `Menu`, `TMenu` and `RclMenu` commands
* help: Automatically create links for references to RPL words.
  When we have `sin` in the Markdown file, the calculator will automatically
  insert a hyperlink to the corresponding entry. Note that this only applies to
  the calculator, not to the GitHub rendering of the Markdown files.
* Display object type in the `Info` box of the interactive stack.
* Fallback graphic rendering of objects to text when the usual heuristics did
  not allow the graphics to fit in the alloted pixel space. For example, a
  fraction that does not fit will now display using the textual form if that
  particular form can fit in the given box.

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug that could cause the text editor cursor to move past the end of the
  editor when inserting text, possibly causing memory corruption.
* The `Show` command will now show all digits, and render fractions using
  multiple lines for the numerator and denominator so as to be able to show more
  digits in a readable way.
* When terminating a command using auto-completion in the `Catalog` feature, the
  command that was entered is now present in the command-line history.
* Arithmetic operations that combine text or lists and unit objects now behave
  correctly. For example, adding a unit to a list appends like any other object.
* directories: Move updir if evaluating an updir directory, instead of
  corrupting the directory stack.
* Clear transient object if entering the interactive stack, e.g. when exploring
  the interactive stack while in the `SolvingMenu` and solving an equation, and
  correctly update the transient object when switching menus.
* Render vectors as RPL code in the equation examples.
* Correctly redraw the text editor when using the interactive stack `Echo`
  feature with stack items spanning multiple lines
* Fix minor typos in the equations documentation.


### Improvements

* tests: Only evaluate after parsing RPL examples in the documentation when the
  stack is not empty
* The `Wait` command now returns a key code in the same style as HP calculators,
  i.e. with row, column and plane. Also, like HP calculators, it processes shift
  keys and returns a plane, instead of returning the keycode of the shift key.

## Release 0.8.2 "Honor Seats" - Equation Library Examples, Assignments

This release is focusing on the testing, validation and usability of the
equation library contributed by Jean Wilson. To that effect, it introduces a new
kind of objects, assignments, that only exist on the DB48x and have no direct
equivalent on original HP calculators. It also completes the support for library
equations in the `Root` command.

Here is an example that illustrates these capabilities, testing the
`Ohm‚Äôs‚ÄÜLaw‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜPower` equation in the library:

```rpl
V=240_V  I=32_A
@ Expecting [ R=7.5‚ÄÜŒ© P=7‚Åü680.‚ÄÜW ]
'ROOT(‚í∫Ohm‚Äôs‚ÄÜLaw‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜPower;[R;P];[1_Œ©;1_W])'
```

If you are reading this release note directly on the calculator, you can simply
click `ENTER` while the text above shows up, and it will be copied in your
editor. You can change the values of the input variables to explore various
possibilities.

In this example, `V=24_V` is an assignment object that assigns the value `24_V`
to the global variable named `V`. It is almost equivalent to `24_V 'V' STO V`,
except that the value placed on the stack is the assignment object itself. In
other words, evaluating `V=24_V` places `V=24_V` on the stack. This makes it
easy to edit or evaluate assignments on the stack using the interactive
stack. In particular, you can select an assignment on the stack wiht the
interactive stack and use the `Eval` (F3) function to restore the variable to
the value in the assignment.

The `ROOT` command in the example illustrates how you can directly use equations
in the equation library as argument to `Root`, and use the multiple-equation
solver to solve for more than one variable at a time.

All the examples in the on-line help are now also tested automatically, in order
to ensure that all the given examples give the expected results.

### Features

* Implement `CustomMenu`, whicih is toggled by successive presses on the _VAR_
  key. An example is shown in the `Demo.48s` file. The content of the `CST` or
  `CustomMenu` variable is used to define this menu.
* The documentation now contains numerous executable examples.
  These examples are identified by a Markdown code block with the `rpl`
  syntax colorization indicator. They can be executed directly from the
  on-line help on the calculator by hitting ENTER while the code block is shown
  on the screen.
* The test suite automatically tests all the documentation examples.
* Two new equation sets, `Light‚ÄÜPropagation` and `Ultrarelativistic‚ÄÜCases`
* Four new equations in `Energy‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜMomentum` equation set
* Assignment objects in the form `Name=Value`, e.g. `A=3`.
* The solver now emits assignment objects for the solution
* `‚ñ∂` command to store while keeping value on stack. As an extension relative to
  the HP50G, this command also works inside RPL algebraic expressions.
  For example `3‚ñ∂A` stores `3` in `A` and returns the value in `A`.
  The command is called `Copy` (the HP50G ARM calls it _‚ñ∂ (Store)_)
* The `Root` command now accepts library equations as input.
* Arrays and lists are now accepted in algebraic expressions, using `;` as
  a separator between values. For example, `'[1;2;3]+[4;5;6]'` adds two vectors
  using an algebraic notation. Vectors can contain algebraic expressions. For
  example `'[x+1;y+2;z=3]'` is a valid vector expression.
* The solver now accepts algebraic input, including for the multiple equation
  solver using vectors as input.
* Ad `RombergPlot` example to Library and Demo file. This example shows how the
  `Integrate` command evaluates the underlying function.
* menus: Add `XRng` and `YRng` to the `PlotMenu`

### Bug fixes:

* Fix a sign bug in the `Simple Slope` equation
* Fix "Too many open files" error while saving constants, xlibs or equations
* Avoid infinite loop for unterminated `case` statement
* What follows a unit in an algebraic expression is no longer ignored.
  `'330_m-20_m'` was incorrectly interpreted as `'330_m'`, now is `'310_m'`.
* Fix and document the `Integrate` imprecision and iteration settings.
* text: Respect display settings in `‚ÜíStr`. For example, `3 FIX 0.1 ‚ÜíStr` now
  returns `"0.100"` and not `"0.1"`, like on HP calculators
* Repair parsing of HP-style complex numbers, e.g. `(12;3)`
* Refactoring of object insertion in text editor to fix various bugs,
  including the `Echo` command in the interactive stack inserting the object at
  the end of the text editor instead of at the cursor position.
* Do not issue `Invalid digit for base` on the console parsing `1E-10`
* Fix null-dereference issue in `to_decimal_if_big`, which could be triggered if
  interrupting an `Integrate` command using the _EXIT_ key.
* Avoid occasional garbage at right of menu area
* simulator: Ensure Copy correctly quotes equations
* Move image for _E Field Finite Line_ to right section

### Improvements

* Add references to keyboard overlays in the documentation
* Add documentation for the `Root` command
* Improve the way we generate the image files in the Makefile
* Improve solver behaviour when a solution is not found. Notably, the solver is
  more likely to converge towards an extremum.

## Release 0.8.0 "Gabriel" - Symbolic operations, equations and library

This release adds symbolic integration, differentiation and equation
solving, delivers an extensive equation library, and improves the
library feature to enable large library objects to be defined in
separate files and optimize execution speed for library items.
It also improves the rendering of complex equations and fixes a number
of crashes or user-interface problems.

### Features

* Symbolic integration, `Primitive` command, `'‚à´X(sin(X))'` syntax
  `'‚à´X(sin(2*X+3)-X)'` evaluates as `'-cos(2*X+3)/2-x¬≤/2'`
* Symbolic differentiation, `Derivative` command, `‚àÇX(sin(X))` syntax
  `'‚àÇX(sin(2*X+3)-X)'` evaluates as `'2¬∑cos(2*X+3)-1'`
* Symbolic equation resolution, `ISOL` (`Isolate`) command
  '`sin(2*X+3)=A' 'X' ISOL` gives `'X=(sin‚Åª¬π A+2*i1*œÄ-3)/2'`
* Apply arithmetic and functions on both sides of equations like `A=B`
  `'A=B' sin 1 +` results in `'sin A+1=sin B+1'`
* Add possibility to define library objects in separate files
  The various demos from previous releases are now also in the library
* commands: Add `‚ÜíProg` command to convert expressions to RPL programs
  `'sin(2*X-Y)' ‚ÜíProg` gives `¬´ 2 X √ó Y - sin ¬ª`
* Accelerate evaluation of library entries
  Invoking a library object is as fast as if it was on the stack.
  Notice that this is faster than global objects that require lookup.
* Add ``Obj‚Üí` support for user-defined function calls
  `'F(A;B;C)' Obj‚Üí DROP Obj‚Üí ` gives `[F A B C]`.
  The first call to `Obj‚Üí` expands the expression, leaving an isolated
  function call on the stack, which the second `Obj‚Üí` expands.
* Automatically convert polynomial objects to expressions when needed
* Many improvements to the equation library contributed by Jean Wilson
* Document the equation library variables in the help file
* Add classical/relativistic Kinetic Energy comparison demo
  This was suggested by Jean Wilson as an illustration
* parser: Parse and convert HP syntax for `|`
  Typing `'A(X;Y)|(X=1;Y=2)'` converts to `'A(X;Y)|X=1|Y=2'`

### Bug fixes

* Improve graphical rendering of some complex expressions
* Render `sqrt` as `‚àö` and not `squareroot` in HP compatibility mode
* Do not draw parentheses around `|x|` when rendering `abs`
* Redefine `rpm` as `turn/min` (unit consistency of rotational speed)

  gives the correct result.
* debug: Debug on error with `DebugOnError` and `KillOnError` settings. This
  makes it easier to debug an RPL program, by making it possible to single-step
  around the instruction that generated the error.
* tests: Add three 30 second demo of DB48X features. These are to generate
  marketing videos for the iPhone version on the Apple store (to be done).


### Bug fixes:

* ui: Keep a GC pointer in `draw_object` to avoid a memory crash
* equations: Add missing units in some equations, e.g. `I` and `A` in second
  equation of Coilumns and Beams
* equations: Add explicit `radian` unit in Eccentric Columns `cos`, which
  ensures we get the correct result from the HP50G manual even when in Degrees
  mode.
* units: Correctly factor out non-integral powers, so that we can compute
  `1/sqrt(epsilon_0*mu_0)` and get the correct result.
* catalog: Display commands that begin with selection first, so that `FORE`
  shows `Foreground` before `AlphaForeground`.
* stats: When computing a sum, evaluate the expression on all terms. The result
  for `Variance` with single variables was wrong because the first term was
  computed incorrectly due to a misguided optimization.
* graphics: Error out in `RGBPattern` for negative input. The negative values
  were generating an error, but it was not reported, so the next command was
  likely to report it.
* help: Render shift keys correctly in the color version. The bitmap was
  interpreted as containing color data. Colorize it instead.

### Improvement

* ui: Select orange as background color during search. The previous setting of
  showing seardch using white foreground on a white background was probably
  pushing the notion of "blind search" a bit too far.

additive congruential random number generator (ACORN), which can be configured
in number of bits and number of iterations. A side effect is that there is now
regression testing for single-variable statistics.

This release is primarily about implementing a dynamic solving menu that makes
it easier to solve equations with multiple variables. This is roughly equivalent
to the "Solve Equation" application in the HP50G.

### New features

* solver: Implement solving menu
* tag: Graphic rendering for tagged objects
* lists: Implement `lname` and `xvars` commands
* arithmetic: Implement `div2` command
* variables: Implement `vars` and `tvars` commands

## Release 0.7.5 "Perfect Joy" - Polynomials and symbolic rewrites

This release contains a lot of groundwork in preparation for future work on
symbolic expressions, symbolic solving and symbolic integration, as well as to
improve compatibility with HP calculators. In particular, `rewrite` has been
replaced with the HP equivalents, `‚ÜëMatch` and `‚ÜìMatch`, allowing top-down and
bottom-up replacement, as well as support for conditions. Also, these commands
return the number of replacements performed instead of just `0` or `1`.

THe other major user-visible new feature is the addition of a polynomials data
type, which does not exist on HP calculators, exposing polynomial features in a
way that is more consistent with the spirit of RPL. For example, Euclidean
division of polynomials can be achieved using the regular `/` operation on
polynomials instead of requiring a dedicated `DIV2` command.


### New features

* Support for polynomials as a data type, including Euclidean division
* Arithmetic operations on polynomials, including `sq` and `cubed`

## Release 0.7.4 "Flesh" - Polishing and refinements

This release is mostly about polishing various aspects of the
implementation to make it more convenient and more efficient. It also
adds user-defined functions parsing and evaluation, pixel-manipulation
commands, bit operations on binary numbers, memory operations like

## Release 0.7.2 "Light" - Libraries, Characters menu

This release introduces four relatively significant features:

1. An Equation Library
2. A more general Library
3. Character menus
4. A character modification catalog

There are also a number of bug fixes and improvements.


### Features

* The *Equation Library* is similar in principle to what is found in the HP50G.
  It is intended to store equations covering a variety of topics.
  The Equation Library is accessible using the _EQS_ key (üü¶ _'()'_).
  It is presently only very sparsely populated, but a future release should
  add the equations listed in Chapter 5 of the *HP50G Advanced User's Reference
  Manual*. Elements of the Equation Library appear as named *Equation Objects*.
  The Equation Library is configured by file `config/equations.csv`.

* The *Library* is similar to the Equation Library, but for all kinds of objects
  such as programs or code snippets. The Library is accessible using the _LIB_
  key (üü¶ _VAR_). It can be used to customize your calculator, and is intended
  to play the roles of the `CST` variable (quick access to common features)
  and Library Objects / XLIB (external extensions to RPL). Elements of the
  Library appear as named *Library Objects*.
  The Library is configured by file `config/library.csv`.

* The *Characters Menu* lets you enter Unicode characters easily, by presenting
  various classes of characters, such as `RPL`, `Greek` or `Punct`.
  The Characters Menus is accessible using the _CHAR_ key (üü¶ _2_).
  It can be used to enter international characters (e.g. Greek or Cyrillic), as
  well as special characters such as arrows or blocks.
  The Characters Menu is configured by file `config/characters.csv`.

* The *Characters Catalog* appears when the `Catalog` is active and the cursor
  is inside some text object. It gives you access to characters that are
  visually close to the character on the left of the cursor. For example, after
  typing `A`, the presented choices include `√Ä`, `a` or `Œ±`.
  The Characters Catalog is configured by file `config/characters.csv`.

* compare: Add comparisons for `true` and `false` values

* Add `TEVAL` command (timed evaluation)


### Bug fixes

* Do not add unnecessary parentheses in ratios, e.g. `(A+B)/(X-Y)`
* Make sure we can save back the configuration files correctly
* Improve access path checks to accept `config:constants.csv`.
* Avoid syntax error in `1/(1+x)` due to `1/` being seen as a fraction
* unitfile: Remove slight risk of bad menu display after garbage collection
* date/time: Make sure we save the stack and last args for `Date`, `Time`, ...
* parser: Skip spacing when parsing numbers (to parse back `‚ÜíText` result)
* time: Fix rendering of DMS time in lists, matrices, vectors
* catalog: Fix a subtle bug on DM32 leading to a crash using the catalog


### Improvements

* constants: Get values of special `œÄ` and `e` by name
* constants: Add prefix in editor to identify constants, equations and xlib
* constants: Represent constants with an index for memory and performance
* constants: Parse units containing text
* constants: Allow `RCL` to recall a constant value
* units: Direct insertion of units after numbers
* menu: Update `Roll` and `RollDown` menu entries
* show: Show all decimals for decimal values
* help: Display the correct on-line help topic for constants
* catalog: Use less memory for the sorted IDs
* integrate: Use numerical computations for faster convergence
* locals: Improve error message for bad locals
* graph: Improve graphical rendering of constants (bold) and equations
* graph: Do not add unnecessary parentheses in ratios
* tests: Add tests for characters menu/catalog
* tests: Fix the `.` vs `0.` test
* ui: Do not enter DMS inside text
* tests: Display disabled tests in gray
* catalog: Keep a single spelling, e.g. no `add` duplicates

## Release 0.7.1 "Whip" - Bug fixes

Inserting variables, constants or units in a program was broken.
Also a few less critical fixes.

### Bug fixes

* decimal: Apply `MinimumSignificantDigits` to `Sig` modes
* tests: Fix missing `]` at end of vector
* ui: Insert commands for unit conversions, constants and variables
* tests: Adjust help screen snapshot for authors
* menus: Do not clip text for hierarchical menus
* constants: Do not use units that don't parse correctly
* dmcp: Day of week convention adjustment
* help: Fix YouTube video preview


## Release 0.7.0 "Temple" - Graphics Equation Rendering

This release introduces a few major improvements, including graphical
rendering of equations and matrices, the `Show` command to display
large objects full-screen, customizable constants, and date-related
operations.

### New features

* Graphical rendering of equations, fractions, matrices, vectors and
  lists. In graphical rendering mode, variables are showin in italics.
* Constants in the `ConstantsMenu`, split into categories, and loading
  from an optional `config/constants.csv` file, in a way
  similar to what existed for units.
* Inverse trigonometric functions (`asin`, `acos` and `atan`) now
  produce unit objects with the current angle mode as a unit. This can
  be configured by the `SetAngleUnits` / `NoAngleUnits` flags.
* `Cycle` (_√ó10‚Åø_ key) now cycles between angle units.
* `R‚ÜíD` and `D‚ÜíR` commands to convert between degree and radian in a
  purely numerical way (no unit). This is for compatibility with HP.
* Add `‚ÜíDeg`, `‚ÜíRad`, `‚ÜíGrad`, `‚ÜíœÄr` commands, which convert a number
  to the target unit using current angle mode, and convert an angle to
  the target angle unit.
* Conversion from DMS to HMS and from HMS to DMS
* Rendering of dates: `19681205_date` renders as `Fri 5/Dec/1968`,
  with a format configuration using the same flags as for the header.
  Note that the date format is `YYYYMMDD`, _not_ the same as on HP
  calculators. This allows `YYYYMMDD.hhmmss` for dates with time.
* `Date` and `Time` command to return the current date and time.
  Additionally, `DateTime` returns both date and time, and
  `ChronoTime` returns the time with 1/100s precision.
* `‚ÜíDate` and `‚ÜíTime` commands to set the system date and time
* `Date+`, `DDays` and date arithmetic using `+` or `-`, using day
  units for the results. As an extension relative to HP calculators,
  these will accept fractional days, or other time units. For example,
  adding `1000000_s` to `19681205_date` generates a date with time
  result, `Tue 16/Dec/1968, 13:46:40`
* `JulianDayNumber` and `DateFromJulianDayNumber` commands to convert
  between dates and Julian day numbers. These commands also accept
  fractional input.
* `Show` command showing a full-screen graphical rendering of the
  result on the stack. The resut is size-adjusted. For example, you
  can display all digits in `200!`. If the result does not fit on the
  screen, you can scroll using the _‚óÄÔ∏é_ and _‚ñ∂Ô∏é_, as well as _8_, _6_,
  _4_ and _2_. The maximum pixel size for `Show` is set by `MaxW`
  (default is the width of the LCD), the maximum height is set by
  `MaxH` (default is 2048 pixels).
* `AutoScaleStack` and `NoAutoScaleStack` settings to automatically
  adjust the font size for the stack elements.
* Support for system flags -20 to -26 (infinite results, overflow and
  underflow).


### Bug fixes

* simulator: Adjust DMCP month off-by-one error
* Repair insertion of `while` loops and similar commands on the
  command line
* Use stack format when drawing an object with `DrawText` (`DISP`)
* Arithmetic on unit objects no longer auto-simplifies, e.g.
  `1_s 1_s -` returns `0_s` and not `0`.
* Perform computations for `‚ÜíQ` using integer values, which avoids an
  issue where increasing the number of iterations with an unachievable
  precision could prodduce `1/1` as the fractional result.
* Repair auto-simplification for `i*i=-1`
* Display a negative mixed fraction as `-1 1/3` and not `1 -1/3`.
* Do not insert `()` after a multiplication in algebraic mode
* Accept units and tagged objects in `PolarToReal` and `RealToPolar`
* Accept angle units as input for `‚ÜíDMS`
* Off-by-one clipping error in header, erasing the shift annunciator
* Fix help for `FC?` (incorrectly stating that it tested for flat set)
* Lookup units and constants in a case sensitive way
* Fix labels for `ExpFit` and `LinFit` in `RegressionMenu`.


### Improvements

* tests: Adjust tests to match bugs fixed in v0.6.5
* dms: Accept entering minutes without third dot, e.g. `1.2.3 ENTER`
* menus: Split the Time, Date and Alarm menus
* Split rendered objects at space boundaries. This notably ensures
  that large numbers are split at digit grouping boundaries, and makes
  it possible to display larger programs on the stack. The rendering
  of programs and matrices/vectors/lists has also been fine-tuned.
* The "white circle" glyph has a thicker border, makes it more
  readable in menus.
* doc: Update the list of unimplemented features
* menus: Draw a white circle for disabled flags, and allow the menu
  function to toggle the flag. This made it possible to reduce the
  number of menu entries for flag-heavy menus.
* Mixed fractions are now the default, as opposed to improper
  fractions
* doc: Improve the quickstart guide
* doc: Improve the documentation for sin, cos and tan
* tests: Make it possible to interrupt a running test
* help: Skip HTML tags, e.g. <video>
* simulator: Add screenshot capability, and reduce window height
* menus: `ToolsMenu` selects time, date or angle menu based on units


## Release 0.6.5 "Testimony": Small bug fixes

This release does not contain much because FOSDEM took a lot of energy.

## New features

* menu: Connect `ceil` and `floor` functions
* Add real to polar conversions
* units: Add `dms` unit to angles menu

## Bug fixes

* decimal: Compute `ln(0.002)` correctly
* integer: Do not parse degree sign if in a complex
* units: Fix parsing of angle units
* font: Add radian glyph


## Release 0.6.4 "Healing": Testing and fixes

This release focuses on heavy testing of the new variable-precision
decimal stack. Adding tests also means finding bugs.

Another significant change is support for fixed-precision
hardware-accelerated floating point, using 32-bit and 64-bit IEEE754
binary floating-point representation. Since this uses a binary format,
some decimal values do not map to decimal correctly. For example,
displaying 1.2 with a large number of decimals will show residue,
because 1.2 does not have an exact (zero-terminated) representation in
binary.

### New features:

* plotting: Make refresh rate configurable
* menu: Add `/` key to `FractionsMenu`
* hwfp: Add support for hardware-accelerated floating-point
* menus: Add hardware floating-point flag to `MathModesMenu`

## Release 0.6.0 "Christmas": Introducing variable precision

This release was a bit longer in coming than earlier ones, because we are about
to reach the limits of what can fit on a DM42. This release uses 711228 bytes
out of the 716800 (99.2%).

Without the Intel Decimal Library code, we use only 282980 bytes. This means
that the Intel Decimal Library code uses 60.2% of the total code space. Being
able to move further requires a rather radical rethinking of the project, where
we replace the Intel Decimal Library with size-optimized decimal code.

As a result, release 0.6.0 introduces a new table-free and variable-precision
implementation of decimal computations. In this release, most operations are
implemented, but some features are still missing (e.g. Gamma function). This
release will be simultaneous with 0.5.2, which is functionally equivalent but
still uses the Intel Decimal library. The new implementation is much more
compact, allowing us to return to normal optimizations for the DM42 and regain
some of the lost performance. On the other hand, having to switch to a table
free implementation means that it's significantly slower than the Intel Decimal
Library. The upside of course is that you can compute with decimal numbers that
have up to 9999 digits, and a decimal exponent that can be up to 2^60
(1‚ÄØ152‚ÄØ921‚ÄØ504‚ÄØ606‚ÄØ846‚ÄØ976).


### New features

Variable precision decimal floating point implementation for arithmetic,
trigonometrics, logs, exponential and integer factorial. Other functions may
still return "unimplemented error".

### Bug fixes

None. If anything, this release introduces bugs in computations and performance
regressions. However, it frees *a lot* of space for further DM42 development.

### Improvements

The `Precision` setting now sets the number of digits with a granularity of one,
between 3 and 9999. Ideal use of memory is with multiples of 12 digits, e.g. 12,
24 or 36 digits, where decimal packing does not cause lost bits.

Performance on the DM42 is somewhat improved, since it is now possible to return
to a higher level of optimization.

### Regressions

In addition to lower performance and unimplemented functions, this version no
longer builds a compatible QSPI. This means that returning to the DM42 requires
flashing *both* the QSPI and the PGM file.


## Release 0.5.2 "Christmas Eve": Reaching hard limits on the DM42

This release was a bit longer in coming than earlier ones, because we are about
to reach the limits of what can fit on a DM42. This release uses 711228 bytes
out of the 716800 (99.2%).

Without the Intel Decimal Library code, we use only 282980 bytes. This means
that the Intel Decimal Library code uses 60.2% of the total code space. Being
able to move further requires a rather radical rethinking of the project, where
we replace the Intel Decimal Library with size-optimized decimal code.

As a result, release 0.5.2 will be the last one using the Intel Decimal Library,
and is release in parallel with 0.6.0, which switches to a table-free and
variable-precisions implementation of decimal code that uses much less code
space. The two releases should otherwise be functionally identical

# Constants library

The DB48X calculator features a library of constants covering mathematics,
physics, chemistry and computer science. The built-in constants can be extended
using the `config/constants.csv` configuration file.

## Mathematics constants

### œÄ constant

The ratio between the circumference and the diameter of a circle.

![Definition of œÄ](img/definition_of_pi.bmp)

### e constant

Euler's constant is the base for the natural logarithm.

![Definition of e](img/definition_of_e.bmp)

### ‚Öà constant

The imaginary unit, such that ‚Öà¬≤=-1.

The picture below shows imaginary unit ‚Öà in the complex plane: Real numbers are
conventionally drawn on the horizontal axis, and imaginary numbers on the
vertical axis.

![Imaginary unit](img/imaginary_unit.bmp)

### ‚Öâ constant

An alternative notation, often preferred by physicists, for the imaginary unit ‚Öà, verifying ‚Öâ¬≤=-1.

### ‚àû constant

Infinity is something that is larger than any natural number.
Its numerical value is an arbitrary large number that is not really infinite.

### ? constant

The undefined constant is used to represent undefined values, such as the result of undefined operations.

## Chemistry constant

### NA constant

Avogradro constant is the number of constituent particles per mole.

### k constant

The Boltzmann constant is the proportionality factor that relates the average
relative thermal energy of particles in a gas with the thermodynamic temperature
of the gas.

### Vm constant

Molar volume of an ideal gas at 1 atmosphere of pressure and 0¬∞C.

### R constant

The universal gas constant is the molar equivalent to the Boltzmann constant,
expressed in units of energy per temperature increment per amount of substance,
rather than energy per temperature increment per particle.

### StdT constant

Standard temperature as defined by IUPAC in 1982.

Standard temperature and pressure (STP) or Standard conditions for temperature
and pressure are various standard sets of conditions for experimental
measurements used to allow comparisons to be made between different sets of
data. The most used standards are those of the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC, used by DB48X) and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST). Other organizations have established a variety of other
definitions.

### StdP constant

Standard pressure as defined by IUPAC in 1982, corresponding to 1 atm

Standard temperature and pressure (STP) or Standard conditions for temperature
and pressure are various standard sets of conditions for experimental
measurements used to allow comparisons to be made between different sets of
data. The most used standards are those of the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC, used by DB48X) and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST). Other organizations have established a variety of other
definitions.

### œÉ constant

Stefan-Boltzmann constant, the factor of proportionality in the Stefan-Boltzmann
law describing the intensity of the thermal radiation emitted by matter in terms
of that matter's temperature.

For an ideal absorber/emitter or black body, the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law states
that the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time (also known
as the radiant exitance) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the
black body's temperature, T:`M¬∞=œÉ¬∑T‚Å¥`


## Physics constants

### ‚Öâ constant

Notation often used in physics for the imaginary verifying ‚Öâ¬≤=-1.

### c constant

Speed of light in vaccuum, a universal physical constant that is exactly equal
to 299,792,458 metres per second (by definition of the metre).

According to the [special theory of relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity),
 *c* is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter or energy
(and thus any signal carrying information) can travel through space.

The [theory of incomplete measurements](http://physics.dinechin.org) presents
space and time as having no existence on their own. We only derive them from
*measurements* of distance and duration made using photons. In that viewpoint,
*c* is the limit of what can be measured using photons. Anything travelling
faster than light is indistinguishable from anti-matter. This is illustrated by
the thought experiment known (or not) as the *bat and the supersonic jet*.
This little tidbit is only mentioned here because this particular theory was
devised by the primary author of DB48X.


### Œµ0 constant

Vacuum permittivity, commonly denoted Œµ0 (pronounced "epsilon nought" or
"epsilon zero"), is the value of the absolute dielectric permittivity of
classical vacuum. It may also be referred to as the permittivity of free space,
the electric constant, or the distributed capacitance of the vacuum. It is an
ideal (baseline) physical constant. It is a measure of how dense of an electric
field is "permitted" to form in response to electric charges and relates the
units for electric charge to mechanical quantities such as length and force.

### Œº0 constant

The vacuum magnetic permeability (variously vacuum permeability, permeability of
free space, permeability of vacuum, magnetic constant) is the magnetic
permeability in a classical vacuum. It is a physical constant, conventionally
written as Œº0 (pronounced "mu nought" or "mu zero"). It quantifies the strength
of the magnetic field induced by an electric current.

### g constant

Acceleration of Earth gravity, equivalent to the free-fall acceleration.

### G constant

The gravitational constant is an empirical physical constant involved in the
calculation of gravitational effects in Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal
gravitation and in Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.

According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the magnitude of the
attractive force (F) between two bodies each with a spherically symmetric
density distribution is directly proportional to the product of their masses, m‚ÇÅ
and m‚ÇÇ, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, r, directed
along the line connecting their centres of mass:

![Newton Gravitation](img/NewtonGravitation.bmp)

### h constant

The Planck constant is a fundamental physical constant that appears in quantum
mechanics. A photon's energy is equal to its frequency multiplied by the Planck
constant (`E=h¬∑ŒΩ`), and the wavelength of a matter wave equals the Planck constant
divided by the associated particle momentum (`Œª=h/p`).

### ‚Ñè constant

The reduced Planck constant, ‚Ñè, also known as the Dirac Constant, is defined as
`‚Ñè=h/2œÄ`.

### qe constant

The elementary electric charge is a fundamental physical constant, defined as
the electric charge carried by a single proton or, equivalently, the magnitude
of the negative electric charge carried by a single electron, which has charge
‚àíqe.

In the SI system of units, the value of the elementary charge is exactly defined
as `qe=1.602176634‚Å≥‚Åª¬π‚Åπ` coulombs. Since the 2019 redefinition of SI base units,
the seven SI base units are defined by seven fundamental physical constants, of
which the elementary charge is one. As a consequence of this change, the value
of that constant in DB48X differs from the value in the HP50G, which named it q,
with value `1.60217733‚Å≥‚Åª¬π‚Åπ` coulombs.

### me constant

Electron mass. In particle physics, the electron mass is the mass of a
stationary electron, also known as the invariant mass of the electron. It is one
of the fundamental constants of physics. It has a value of about `9.109‚Å≥‚Åª¬≥¬π`
kilograms

### qme constant

Ratio between the electron charge and its mass.

### mp constant

Mass of the proton.

### mpme constant

Ratio between the mass of the proton and the mass of the electron.

### Œ± constant

Fine-structure constant. In physics, the fine-structure constant, also known as
the Sommerfeld constant, commonly denoted by Œ± (the Greek letter alpha), is a
fundamental physical constant which quantifies the strength of the
electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles.

It is a dimensionless quantity, independent of the system of units used, which
is related to the strength of the coupling of an elementary charge e with the
electromagnetic field.

### √∏ constant

Magnetic flux quantum. The (superconducting) magnetic flux quantum is a
combination of fundamental physical constants: the Planck constant h and the
electron charge e. Its value is, therefore, the same for any superconductor.

### F constant

Faraday constant. In physical chemistry, the Faraday constant is a physical
constant defined as the quotient of the total electric charge (q) by the amount
(n) of elementary charge carriers in any given sample of matter

### R‚àû constant

Rydberg constant. In spectroscopy, the Rydberg constant is a physical constant
relating to the electromagnetic spectra of an atom. The constant first arose as
an empirical fitting parameter in the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen spectral
series, but Niels Bohr later showed that its value could be calculated from more
fundamental constants according to his model of the atom.

### a0 constant

Bohr radius. The Bohr radius is a physical constant, approximately equal to the
most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom
in its ground state.

### ŒºB constant

Bohr magneton. In atomic physics, the Bohr magneton is a physical constant and
the natural unit for expressing the magnetic moment of an electron caused by its
orbital or spin angular momentum. In SI units, the Bohr magneton is defined as
`ŒºB=qe*‚Ñè/(2¬∑me)`.


### ŒºN constant

The nuclear magneton is a physical constant of magnetic moment, defined in SI
units by `ŒºN=qe¬∑‚Ñè/(2¬∑mp)`.


### Œª0 constant

Photon wavelength. Photon energy can be expressed using any unit of energy such
as the electronvolt (eV) or the Joule (J). For short wavelength sources,
researchers often discuss photon energies in units of eV (or keV for hard
X-rays) out of convenience.  The SI definition for 1‚ÄÜeV derives from the
[definitional value of the electron charge](#me-constant). Photon energy `E` in
eV can be computed from wavelength `l` in nm as: `E=Œª0/l`.

### f0 constant

Photon frequency. This is the frequency associated to the
[photon wavelength Œª0][#Œª0-constant].

### Œªc constant

Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength is a quantum mechanical property of a
particle, defined as the wavelength of a photon whose energy is the same as the
rest energy of that particle (based on the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence).

The standard Compton wavelength `Œª` of a particle of mass `m` is given by
`Œª=h/(m¬∑c)`

### rad constant

One radian.

### twoœÄ constant

Two œÄ radian (one full circle).

### angl constant

Half turn in degrees.

### c3 constant

Wien's constant. In physics, Wien's displacement law states that the black-body
radiation curve for different temperatures will peak at different wavelengths
that are inversely proportional to the temperature. The shift of that peak is a
direct consequence of the Planck radiation law, which describes the spectral
brightness or intensity of black-body radiation as a function of wavelength at
any given temperature. However, it had been discovered by German physicist
Wilhelm Wien several years before Max Planck developed that more general
equation, and describes the entire shift of the spectrum of black-body radiation
toward shorter wavelengths as temperature increases.

Formally, the wavelength version of Wien's displacement law states that the
spectral radiance of black-body radiation per unit wavelength, peaks at the
wavelength `Œªpeak=c3/T` where `T` is absolute temperature.

### kq constant

Ratio of the [Boltzman constant][#k-constant] by the
[elementary charge](#qe-constant): `kq=k/qe`.

### Œµ0q constant

Ratio of the [vaccum permittivity](#Œµ0-constant) by the
[elementary charge](#qe-constant): `Œµ0q=Œµ0/qe`.


### qŒµ0 constant

Product of the [vaccum permittivity](#Œµ0-constant) by the
[elementary charge](#qe-constant): `qŒµ0=Œµ0¬∑qe`.

### Œµsi constant

Dielectric constant of silicon. The dielectric constant (or relative
permittivity), is a material property that measures how well an applied electric
field can penetrate a dielectric medium compared to a vacuum. A higher value
corresponds to a lower penetration.

### Œµox constant

SiO2 dielectric constant. The dielectric constant (or relative
permittivity), is a material property that measures how well an applied electric
field can penetrate a dielectric medium compared to a vacuum. A higher value
corresponds to a lower penetration.

### I0 constant

Reference sound intensity. Sound intensity level or acoustic intensity level is
the level of the intensity of a sound relative to a reference value. It is a
logarithmic quantity, most often expressed in decibels dB. I0 is the sound
intensity used as a reference, corresponding to 0dB.


## Dates Constants

### BastilleDay constant

French national day

### MartinLutherKingDeath constant

Martin Luther King Jr., an African-American clergyman and civil rights movement
leader, was fatally shot at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April
4, 1968, at 6:01 p.m.

### IndependenceDay constant

Independence Day, known colloquially as the Fourth of July, is a federal holiday
in the United States which commemorates the ratification of the Declaration of
Independence by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, establishing
the United States of America.

### Coulomb‚Äôs‚ÄÜLaw‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜE‚ÄÜField

These equations describe the electrostatic force between two point charged particles and the electric field observed at the position of a test charge which replaces one of the two charges `q1` or `q2` in the expression of the electric force. A finite object carrying a net charge `q1` can be considered as a point charge if the distance to the position of the point charge `q2` is much greater than the object dimension, see example 2, for the approximate calculations of the electric force and electric field far away from a charged plate.

* **Example 1**. To calculate `[F_N;Er_N/C]` (Electric force; Electric Field) from 5 known variables:

```rpl
q1=1.6E-19_C  q2=1.6E-19_C  r=4.00E-13_cm  Œµr=1  qtest=1.6E-19_C

'ROOT(‚í∫Coulomb‚Äôs‚ÄÜLaw‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜE‚ÄÜField;[F;Er];[1_N;1_N/C])'
```

* **Example 2**. A square metal plate `L = 8_cm` on a side carries a charge of `q1 = 6_ŒºC`. Approximate values of the electric force & electric field for a point charge `q2 = 1_ŒºC` located at `r = 3_m` can be calculated with Coulomb‚Äôs law if the separation distance is much greater than the plate dimension `r >> L`. The whole plate is indeed considered as being a point charge providing that `r > 10 ¬∑ L`. Therefore, to calculate `[F_N;Er_N/C]`:

```rpl
L=8_cm r=3_m q1=6E-6_C  q2=1E-6_C  r=3_m  Œµr=1  qtest=1E-6_C
@ Expecting [ F=5.99170‚Åü11915‚Åü9‚Å≥‚Åª¬≥‚ÄÜN Er=5‚Åü991.70119‚Åü159‚ÄÜN/C ]
if 'r > 10*L' then
 'ROOT(‚í∫Coulomb‚Äôs‚ÄÜLaw‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜE‚ÄÜField;[F;Er];[1_N;1_N/C])'
end
```

### E‚ÄÜField‚ÄÜInfinite‚ÄÜLine

The expression for the radial electric field at the distance `r` is approximately valid if this distance is such that `r << L` and therefore also applies to a wire of finite length `L`.

* To calculate `[Œª_C/m;Er_N/C]` (Linear charge density; Electric Field) from 4 known variables:

```rpl
Q=5E-6_C  L=3_m  r=0.05_m  Œµr=1
@ Expecting [ Œª=1.66666‚Åü66666‚Åü7‚Å≥‚Åª‚Å∂‚ÄÜC/m Er=599‚Åü170.11915‚Åü9‚ÄÜN/C ]
'ROOT(‚í∫E‚ÄÜField‚ÄÜInfinite‚ÄÜLine;[Œª;Er];[1_C/m;1_N/C])'
```

The code below saves the reference value for comparison with the example in [E‚ÄÜField‚ÄÜFinite‚ÄÜLine](#E‚ÄÜField‚ÄÜFinite‚ÄÜLine):
```rpl
@ Save the reference value for comparison below
Er0=Er
```

### E‚ÄÜField‚ÄÜFinite‚ÄÜLine

The expression of the radial electric field at the distance `r` depends on the subtended angles `Œ∏1` and `Œ∏2` relative to the ends of the wire of finite length `L`.

![E field finite line](img/EFieldFiniteLine.bmp)

* **Example 1.** To calculate `[Œª_C/m;Er_N/C]` (Electric Field; Linear charge density) from 6 known variables and also with the distance `r=(L/2)/tanŒ∏1` and angle `Œ∏2=360¬∞-Œ∏1` (see figure):

```rpl
r='(3_m)/(2*tan 30_¬∞)' Œ∏2='360_¬∞-30_¬∞'

'ROOT(‚í∫E‚ÄÜField‚ÄÜFinite‚ÄÜLine;[Œª;Er];[1_C/m;1_N/C])'
```

* **Example 2.** To show that the infinite line of the previous section can approximate the finite case (if `r << L` realised when `r < L/10`), we calculate `[Œª_C/m;Er_N/C]` with the angles `Œ∏1=ATAN((L/2)/r)` and `Œ∏2=360¬∞-Œ∏1` (see figure):

```rpl
Q=5E-6_C  L=3_m  r=5_cm  Œµr=1  Œ∏1='atan(L/2/r)' Œ∏2='360_¬∞-Œ∏1'
if 'r < L/10' then

'ROOT(‚í∫E‚ÄÜField‚ÄÜFinite‚ÄÜLine;[Œª;Er];[1_C/m;1_N/C])'
end
```

### E‚ÄÜField‚ÄÜInfinite‚ÄÜPlate

The expression of the perpendicular electric field is constant over an infinite plate and can approximate the field at a distance `d` from a finite plate if it is very small compare to the dimensions (length or width `L`) of the plate. On the contrary if `d >> L`, `Ep` can be approximated if we consider the whole plate as being a point charge with `q = œÉ¬∑A` (where `œÉ` is the surface charge density), see example 2 of [Coulomb‚Äôs Law & E Field](#Coulomb‚Äôs‚ÄÜLaw‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜE‚ÄÜField).

* To calculate `[Ep_N/C;œÉ_C/m^2]` (Electric Field; Linear charge density) at position `[d=5_mm]` above a square plate of width `[L=8_cm]` and surface `A=L^2` where `d << L` when `d < L/10` is verified:

```rpl

This depends on the mass of the star or planet and the distance `r` center to center (where we assume that the position is greater than the radius of the mass). For the Earth, we can calculate an approximate value `gearth` of the acceleration of gravity as a function of latitude `œÜ` and for an altitude `h` low compared to the Earth's radius (typically: a few thousand meters, valid in commercial aviation).

* `v1, v2`: Velocity at heights h1 and h2
* `vg`: Tangential speed of the ground of a rotatong planet
* `Vs`: Schwarzschild  volume of a black hole

* `z`: Gravitational redshift parameter

The relativistic transformations are parametrized by the real constant `v` representing a velocity confined to the x-direction. The respective inverse transformation is then parameterized by the negative of this velocity.

#### Lorentz‚ÄÜTransformation

The primed reference frame `[xp yp zp]` is travelling with velocity `v` in the positive x direction. Therefore, the y and z coordinates of the rest frame remain unchanged.

#### Time‚ÄÜDilation

The dilation comes from the fact that the Lorentz factor `Œ≥` is greater or equal to one and the proper time interval is multiplied by this factor.

#### Space‚ÄÜContraction

The contraction comes from the fact that the Lorentz factor `Œ≥` is greater or equal to one and the proper space interval is divided by this factor.

#### Velocity‚ÄÜSuperposition

These expressions replace the usual Galilean addition of velocities. It can be checked that superposing with `v = c` leads to `upx = c`, hence the impossibility to superpose velocities to go beyond the velocity limit `c`. Since the velocity `v` is confined to the x-direction, the y and z components of velocity remain unchanged.

#### Acceleration‚ÄÜSuperposition

Even if the velocity `v` is confined to the x-direction, all components of the observed acceleration are transformed in the moving frame.

#### E‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜB‚ÄÜFields‚ÄÜTransformation

#### Longitudinal‚ÄÜDoppler‚ÄÜEffect

#### Transverse‚ÄÜDoppler‚ÄÜEffect

#### Energy‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜMomentum

The total relativistic energy `E` and the norm of the momentum `p` form the invariant `mo¬∑c^2` which remains the same in all frames. The kinetic energy `K` is the difference between the total relativistic energy `E` and the rest energy `E0 = mo¬∑c^2`.

#### Gravitational‚ÄÜTime‚ÄÜDilation

#### Gravitational‚ÄÜRedshift

#### Circumnavigating‚ÄÜAirplanes

It is assumed that the planes are circumnavigating at the same altitude `h`, same latitude `œÜ` and the during same flight duration `Œît` measured in the airplanes. The ground is rotating with the planet at the angular frequency `œâ`. The Schwarzschild metric is taken into account. The calculation should formally invokes an integral for the elapsed proper time along a path and is approximated here to the first order in speed since the velocities of the plane and the planet surface are << `c` (slow airplanes over a slow rotating planet).

#### Clocks‚ÄÜat‚ÄÜdifferent‚ÄÜheights

It is assumed that the two clocks are at rest with respect to the ground at a latitude `œÜ` and are rotating with the planet at the angular frequency `œâ`. The clocks are at their respective heights `h1` and `h2` for inxtance at the top and bottom of a mountain. For simplicity, the planet is assumed to have a spherical distribution. The Schwarzschild metric is taken into account. The calculation should formally invokes an integral for the elapsed proper time along a path and is approximated here to the first order in speed since the tangential velociies at height `h1` and `h2` are << `c` (slow rotating planet).

#### Planck‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜWien‚ÄÜComparison

In this section, two comparisons are done between the Planck and Wien spectral distributiona. Based on a incomplete thermodynamic argument, the latter is an approximation of the true Planck law describing the spectral distribution for the light emitted by a black-body. The choice of temperature `T` determines the frequency ranges for integration between `f1` and `f2`, or between `f3` and `f4`. One shall determine in which frequency interval both distribution differs notably or agree. The asymptotic agreement for large frequency is clearly illustrated in the picture. The user is free to choose one or the other comparison fractions (replacing it in `Frfafb`) to compute the corresponding enissive power and the heat transfer rate from the black-body.

![Planck & Wien Comparison](img/Planck&Wien_Distributions.bmp)

#### Planck‚ÄÜ&‚ÄÜRayleigh-Jeans‚ÄÜComparison

In this section, two comparisons are done between the Planck and Rayleigh-Jeans spectral distributiona. Based on the equipartition theorem argument, the latter is an approximation of the true Planck law describing the spectral distribution for the light emitted by a black-body. The choice of temperature `T` determines the frequency ranges for integration between `f1` and `f2`, or between `f3` and `f4`. One shall determine in which frequency interval both distribution agree or differs considerably, leading to a divergence called UV catastrophy corresponding to unphysical fractions greather than one. The asymptotic agreement for small frequency is clearly illustrated in the picture. The user is free to choose one or the other comparison fractions (replacing it in `Frfafb`) to compute the corresponding enissive power and the heat transfer rate from the black-body.

![Planck & Rayleigh-Jeans Comparison](img/Planck&Rayleigh-Jeans_Distributions.bmp)

#### Photoelectric‚ÄÜEffect

Einstein explained the photoelectric effect with the energy quantification of the electromagnetic wave. The photoelectron is then emitted only if the energy `E` of the incident photon is greather or equal to the work function `œÜ` of the material. A simple energy budget equation determines the maximum kinetic energy `Kmax` of the photoelectron.

#### Compton‚ÄÜEffect

In the Compton effect, both energy and momentum are conserved during the collision of the incident photon and the electron, which underlines the fact that the photon must henceforth be considered as a particle. When a high frequency `f` (or energy `E = hf`) photon scatters due to an interaction with a charged particle, there is a decrease in the energy of the photon emitted at an angle `Œ∏` and thus, an increase in its wavelength `Œªp`. The energy of the ejected electron `Kmax` is relativist.

#### De‚ÄÜBroglie‚ÄÜWave

At all scales where measurements have been possible, matter exhibits wave-like behavior (e.g. Young interference for protons, even for molecules). More precisely, a beam of neutron can be diffracted just like a beam of light or a water wave as it is the case in the Bragg diffraction. Here, the interference is constructive when the phase difference between the matter wave reflected off different atomic planes at an angle `Œ∏` is a multiple of 2œÄ, giving the Following condition: `2¬∑d¬∑SINŒ∏ = n¬∑Œª` with `n` integer and where `Œ∏` is mesured between the refected waves trajectory and the atomic plane.

* `Zb`: Proton number of the incident nuclide or or charge of the product particle b
* `ZX`: Proton number of the reactant nuclide X
* `ZY`: Proton number of the product nuclide Y

For all nuclear reactions, including nuclear decays, we have charge conservation `Zp = Z` and mass number conservation `Mp = M` (the same number of nucleons). This therefore requires assigning numbers A and Z to incident particles `a` and `b` whether they are for example gamma photons (`A = 0`, Z = 0`), positrons (`A = 0`, Z = -1`) or others. The reaction energy `Q` is always calculated with the mass-energy equivalence by the mass difference between the reactants and the products. Spontaneous decays are for instance always exothermic `Q > 0` while some nuclear reactions can be endothermic `Q < 0`.

'1=2.0-1.0' Evaluate
```

In most cases, `=` is the best replacement for `==` in programs written for
HP variants of RPL.


## ‚â†

Check if two values are mathematically different. This is the opposite of `=`.

```rpl
@ Expecting False
'1‚â†2.0-1.0' Evaluate
```

## ==

Checks if two objects are identical after evaluating names
(contrary to `same`).

```rpl
A=1
'A==1' Evaluate
@ Expecting True
```

Unlike `=`, `==` takes the type of the object into account, meaning that
`'1==1.0'` evaluates as `False`.

```rpl
'1==2.0-1.0' Evaluate
@ Expecting False
```

## Same

Checks if two objects are identical without evaluating names
(contrary to `==`).

```rpl
A=1
'A' 1 SAME
@ Expecting False
```


## <

Check if the first value is less than the second value.

```rpl
{}
1 2 < + 2.3 1.2 < +
"ABC" "DEF" < + "a" "√†" < +
{ 1 2 3 } { 1 2 4 } < + { 1 2 3 } { 1 2 3 } < +
@ Expecting { True False True True True False }
```

## ‚â§

Check if the first value is less than or equal to the second value.

```rpl
{}
1 2 ‚â§ + 2.3 1.2 ‚â§ +
"ABC" "DEF" ‚â§ + "a" "√†" ‚â§ +
{ 1 2 3 } { 1 2 4 } ‚â§ + { 1 2 3 } { 1 2 3 } ‚â§ +
@ Expecting { True False True True True True }
```

## >

Check if the first value is greater than the second value.

```rpl
{}
1 2 > + 2.3 1.2 > +
"ABC" "DEF" > + "a" "√†" > +
{ 1 2 3 } { 1 2 4 } > + { 1 2 3 } { 1 2 3 } > +
@ Expecting { False True False False False False }
```

## ‚â•

Check if the first value is greater than or equal to the second value.

```rpl
{}
1 2 ‚â• + 2.3 1.2 ‚â• +
"ABC" "DEF" ‚â• + "a" "√†" ‚â• +
{ 1 2 3 } { 1 2 4 } ‚â• + { 1 2 3 } { 1 2 3 } ‚â• +
@ Expecting { False True False False False True }

# Debugging

DB48X offers a variety of capabilities to help debugging RPL programs. These are
made available through the [DebugMenu](#debugmenu), which is the menu that
[ToolsMenu](#toolsmenu) selects when a program is on the stack.


## DebugMenu

The debug menu contains operations necessary to debug RPL programs:

* [Debug](#debug)
* [Step](#singlestep)
* [Over](#stepover)
* [Steps](#multiplesteps)
* [Continue](#continue)
* [Halt](#halt)
* [Kill](#kill)
* [Step‚Üë](#stepout)


## Debug

The `Debug` command takes a program or expression as an argument, and starts
debugging execution of it. When a program is halted for debugging, the header
area shows a _‚ô¶_ symbol, and the next instruction to be executed is shown above
the stack. When a program is single-stepping, the header area shows a _‚Ä∫_
symbol.

While a program is being debugged, you can use the command line normally and
even execute programs from it. However, only a single debugging session can
exist. If the program being executed halts, e.g. through the `HALT` command or
by being interrupted using the _EXIT_ key, then this is seen as part of the same
debugging session.


## SingleStep

The `SingleStep` command steps through a single instruction in the RPL program.


## StepOver

The `StepOver` command steps over the next instruction. If the next instruction
is a variable name containing a program, execution halts after executing the
program. If the next instruction being shown is a sequence of instructions, for
example the test or the sequence of instructions in tests or loops, then the
entire sequence is evaluated at once.

## StepOut

The `StepOut` command steps out of the current code block.

## MultipleSteps

The `MultipleSteps` instruction evaluates an arbitrary number of steps in the
program being debugged. The number of steps to execute is passed as an argument
in the first level of the stack. For example, `40 MultipleSteps` will execute
the next 40 RPL instructions.

## Continue

The `Continue` command resumes execution of the current RPL program at the
current instruction.

## Halt

The `Halt` instruction interrupts the execution of a program, making it possible
to insert breakpoints at specific locations in a program.

## Kill

The `Kill` instruction stops the execution of the program currently being
debugged.
# Variables

Variables are named storage for RPL values.

## Store

Store an object into a specified location. For example `2 'ABC' STO` stores the value `2` in a global variable named `ABC`.

`Value` `Name` ‚ñ∂

The `Value` is copied in a storage location identified by `Name`. The storage location depends on the type of `Name`, which can be quoted in an expression:

* Symbol or integer: The value is stored in a global variable with that name in the current directory, which is created if necessary. Whether integers can be used as variable names depends on the `NumberedVariables` setting.

* Local name: The value is stored in the corresponding local variable.

* Setting name: The value is used for the corresponding setting, as if the setting command had been executed. For example, `16 'Base' STO` has the same effect as `16 Base`.

* Text: `Value` is stored in a named file on the [flash storage](#flash-storage).


## Recall
Recall an object from a specified location. For example `'ABC' RCL` recalls the value from a global variable named `ABC`.

`Name` ‚ñ∂ `Value`

The `Value` is fetched from a storage location identified by `Name`. The storage location depends on the type of `Name`, which can be quoted in an expression:

* Symbol or integer: The value is fetched from a global variable with that name in the current directory or any enclosing directory. Whether integers can be used as variable names depends on the `NumberedVariables` setting.

* Local name: The value is fetched from the corresponding local variable.

* Setting name: The value is fetched from the corresponding setting. For example, `'Base' RCL` returns the current value as set by `Base`.

* Text: `Value` is fetched from a named file on the [flash storage](#flash-storage)


## Flash storage

SwissMicros calculators have built-in flash storage, that can act as a USB disk when the calculator is connected to a computer. DB48X can read and write to this flash storage using the regular `STO` and `RCL` commands, simply by giving a text containing the file name as the `Name` argument of these commands.

The format of the file depends on how the name ends:

* `.txt`: the value is stored as text.

* `.48s`: the value is stored as source code in text format. This differs from `.txt` files for text objects, which will be quoted.

* `.48b`: the value is stored in version-specific binary format. This format is only guaranteed to be readable by the same firmware version that wrote it, but it is more compact, faster and energy efficient than the source format.

* `.csv`: The value is stored in comma-separated values format. This is mostly interesting for arrays and lists, which can be echanged with spreadsheets and other PC applications that can input or output CSV files.


## STO+
Add a value to the content of a variable


## STO-
Subtract a value from the contents of a variable


## STO√ó
Multiply the contents of a variable by a value


## STO√∑
Divide the contents of a variable by a value


## RCL+
Add the content of a variable to a value on the stack


## RCL-
Subtract the contents of a variable from a value on a stack


## RCL√ó
Multiply a value on the stack by the contents of a variable
The value in the variable is multiplied on the right, in cases where
multiplication is non-commutative (e.g. matrix multiplication).


## RCL√∑
Divide a value on the stack by the contents of a variable


## Increment
Add one to the content of a variable


## Decrement
Subtract one from content of a variable


## Purge

Delete a global variable from the current directory

*Remark*: `Purge` only removes a variable from the current directory, not the
enclosing directories. Since [Recall](#Recall) will fetch variable values from
enclosing directories, it is possible that `'X' Purge 'X' Recall` will fetch a
value for `X` from an enclosing directory. Use [PurgeAll](#PurgeAll) if you want
to purge a variable including in enclosing directories.

## PurgeAll

Delete a global variable from the current directory and enclosing directories.

*Remark*: If a variable with the same name exists in multiple enclosing
directories, `PurgeAll` may purge multiple variables. Use [Purge](#Purge) if you
want to only purge a variable in the current directory.


## CreateDirectory
Create new directory


## PurgeDirectory
Purge entire directory tree


## UpDirectory
Change current directory to its parent


## HomeDirectory
Change current directory to HOME


## DirectoryPath
Get a path to the current directory


## Variables

List all visible variables in a directory

‚ñ∂ `{ Variables... }`


## TypedVariables

List variables of a specific type

`type` ‚ñ∂ `{ Variables... }`
`{ types... }` ‚ñ∂ `{ Variables... }`

See the `Type` command for a list of types.

## Copy

Copy a value into a global variable. This is primarily intended for use in
algebraic notations, although it also works in RPL. The HP50G Advanced Reference
Manual refers to this command as _‚ñ∂ (Store)_.

```rpl
'(2+5)‚ñ∂X' EVAL
42 'A' ‚ñ∂ 1 +
{} X + A + +
@ Expecting { 43 7 42 }
```

The command returns the stored object on the stack. The returned copy is a
direct reference to the stored global object and does not consume additional
memory.

## Assignment

An assignment is an RPL object in the form `Name=Value` that sets a global
variable to a given value. It is intended primarily to facilitate the
interactive use of library equations.

An assignment evaluates `Value`, stores it into `Name`, and puts the original
assignment object on the stack. If the `PushEvaluatedAssignment` setting is
active, then the assignment object pushed on the stack contains the evaluated
value. Otherwise (by default) it contains the unevaluated value.

The `Name=Value` syntax is only accepted outside of expressions. In expressions,
`Name=Value` represents the `=` operator applied to `Name` and `Value`, and is
used among other things to define equations for the solver. If an assignment
object appears in an expression, it will render as `Value‚ñ∂Name` so that parsing
it would turn it into a `Copy` operation.


### Assignments with the solver

Assignments are useful in conjonction with the solver. For example, the
following example will solve a simple triangle equation for specific values of
`Œ±` and `Œ≤`.

```rpl
Œ±=20 Œ≤=30
'ROOT(Œ±+Œ≤+Œ≥=180;Œ≥;0)' EVAL
@Expecting Œ≥=130.
```

```rpl
Œ≤=30 Œ≥=60
'ROOT(Œ±+Œ≤+Œ≥=180;Œ±;0)' EVAL
@Expecting Œ±=90.
```

The interactive stack, in combination with the `Eval` or `Edit` buttons, makes
it possible to return to earlier values. This can also be tried with the
interactive `SolvingMenu`:

```rpl
'Œ±+Œ≤+Œ≥=180' STEQ RCEQ
SolvingMenu
```



### PushEvaluatedAssignment

When evaluating `A='2+3*5'`, pushes `A=17` on the stack.

### PushOriginalAssignment

When evaluating `A='2+3*5'`, pushes `A='2+3*5'` on the stack.

# Flow control

## If

The `if` statement provides conditional structurs that let a program make
decisions. It comes in two forms:

* `if` *condition* `then` *true-clause* `end`: This evaluates *condition* and,
  if true, evaluates *true-clause*.

* `if` *condition* `then` *true-clause* `else` *false-clause* `end`: This
  evaluates *condition* and, if true, evaluates *true-clause*, otherwise
  evaluates *false-clause*.

A condition is true if:
* It is a number with a non-zero value
* It is the word `True`

A condition is false if:
* It is a number with a zero value
* It is the word `False`


## Case

The `case` statement can be used to select one case among many.
Inside a `case`, there is a list of conditions, each followed by `then` or
`when`. Code following `then` or `when` is executed when the condition is met.

* A condition preceding `then` is a boolean condition, similar to the condition
  in an `if` statement.

* A condition preceding `when` is a value that must match the current value on
  the stack exactly.

For example, `X case dup 0 < then "N" end dup 0 > then "P" end "Z" end`
will return the value `"N"`, `"P"` or `"Z"` depending on whether `X` is
negative, positive or null.

The `when` syntax is useful to test exact values, for example
`X case 0 when "zero" end 1 when "one" end 2 when "two" end end` will compute
the English spelling for value `0`, `1` and `2`.

# Graphic commands

DB48X features a number of graphic commands. While displaying graphics, the
stack and headers will no longer be updated.

## Coordinates

DB48X recognizes the following types of coordinates

* *Pixel coordinates* are specified using based numbers such as `#0`, and
  correspond to exact pixels on the screen, and . Pixels are counted starting
  from the top-left corner of the screen, with the horizontal coordinate going
  from `10#0` to `10#399`, and the vertical coordinate going from `10#0` to
  `10#239`.

* *User unit coordinates* are scaled according to the content of the `PPAR` or
  `PlotParameters` reserved variables.

* *Text coordinates* are given on a square grid with a size corresponding to the
  height of a text line in the selected font. They can be fractional.

Coordinates can be given using one the following object types:

* A complex number, where the real part represents the horizontal coordinate and
  the imaginary part represents the vertical coordinate.

* A 2-element list or vector containing the horizontal and vertical coordinates.

* A 1-element list of vector containing one of the above.

For some operations, the list or vector can contain additional parameters beyond
the coordinates. The selection of unit or pixel coordinates is done on a per
coordinate basis. For exmaple, `{ 0 0 }` will be the origin in user coordinates,
in the center of the screen if no `PPAR` or `PlotParameters` variable is
present.

Note that unlike on the HP48, a complex value in DB48X can
contain a based number.


## ClearLCD

Clear the LCD display, and block updates of the header or menu areas.


## DrawText

Draw the text or object in level 2 at the position indicated by level 1. A text
is drawn without the surrounding quotation marks.

If the position in level 1 is an integer, fraction or real number, it is
interpreted as a line number starting at 1 for the top of the screen. For
example, `"Hello" 1 disp` will draw `Hello` at the top of the screen.
If the position is a based number, it is a row number in pixels. For example,
`"Hello" #120d disp` will show the test in the middle of the screen.

If the position in level 1 is a complex number or a list, it is interpreted as
specifying both the horizontal or vertical coordinates, in either pixel or unit
coordinates. For example `"Hello" { 0 0 } disp` will draw `Hello` starting in
the center of the screen.

Text is drawn using the stack font by default, using the
[foreground](#foreground) and [background](#background) patterns.

If level 1 contains a list with more than 2 elements, additional elements
provide:

* A *font number* for the text

* An *erase* flag (default true) which indicates whether the background for the
  text should be drawn or not.

* An *invert* flag (default false) which, if set, will swap the foreground and
  background patterns.

* An *horizontal align* value, where -1 means align left, 1 means align right,
  and 0 means center the text. Note that fractional values or values below -1 or
  above 1 are allowed for special effects.

* A *vertical align* value, where -1 means align top, 1 means align bottom, and
  0 means center the text vertically. Note that fractional values or values
  below -1 or above 1 are allowed for special effects.

For example, the following code will draw `Hello` in the
top-left corner (`#0 #0`) with the largest (editor) font (font identifier `3`),
erasing the background (the first `true`), in reverse colors (the second
`true`), and then draws `World` in the bottom right corner.

```rpl
"Hello" { #0 #0 3 true true } DrawText
"World" { 10#400 10#240 3 true true -1 -1 } DrawText
```

## DrawStyledText

Draw the text or object in level 3 at the position indicated by level 2, using
the font specified in level 1. This behaves like [DrawText](#drawtext), except
for the additional parameter specifying the font size.

This command is compatible with the HP50G usage, where the position is specified
by a list containing two decimal integer values. A font size of 1 displays with
a small font, a font size of 2 displays with a regular font.

In addition to this HP50G-compatible usage, `DispXY` will also accept:

* A smaller font size, 0, for the help size, and other font sizes above 2, which
  are compatible with the values given to [StackFont](#stackfont).

* The position can accept the same values as [DrawText](#drawtext), including a
  single integer value indicating a line number, a fractional line position, or
  coordinates scaled according to [PlotParameters](#plotparameters).


## Show

Display the first level of the stack using the entire screen, with a possible
scroll using the 4, 8, 6 and 2 keys if the object is larger than fits on screen.
This makes it possible to comfortably examine very large objects, like `300!`, a
large program or a complicated equation. Arrow keys can also be used for
horizonal or vertical scrolling.

The maximum size of the graphic object is defined by the
[MaximumShowWidth](#maximumshowwidth) and
[MaximumShowHeight](#maximumshowheight) settings.

## DrawLine

Draw a line between two points specified by level 1 and level 2 of the stack.

The width of the line is specified by [LineWidth](#linewidth). The line is drawn
using the [foreground](#foreground) pattern.


## PlotParameters

The `PlotParameters` reserved variable defines the plot parameters, as a list,
with the following elements:

* *Lower Left* coordinates as a complex (default `-10-6i`)

* *Upper Right* coordinates as a complex (default `10+6i`)

* *Independent variable* name (default `x`)

* *Resolution* specifying the interval between values of the independent
  variable (default `0`). A binary numnber specifies a resolution in pixels.

* *Axes* which can be a complex giving the origin of the axes (default `0+0i`),
  or a list containing the origin, the tick mark specification, and the names of
  the axes.

* *Type* of plot (default `function`)

* *Dependent variable* name (default `y`)


## Pict

`Pict` is the name given to the graphics shown on the calculator's screen.
It can only be used as an argument to `Store`, `Recall` and graphical
operations such as `GAnd`.

[Not fully implemented yet: `Store` and `Recall` do not work]


# Bitmap operations

## ToGrob

Creates a graphics object from a specified object on the stack.

The first level of the stack specifies the character size used while
rendering the object, where value `0` indicates the `StackFont` value.

If the second level of the stack is a text, then the quotes that appear
the text is displayed on the stack will not be included in the generated
graphic object. This is similar to the behaviour of `Disp`. The rendering
of objects respects the settings used to render on the stack, e.g.
`FIX` mode or `VerticalVectors`.

The object to draw must fit in a bit map at most `MaxW`-pixels wide and
`MaxH`-pixels high.


```rpl
@ Show font sizes
0 7 for fontID
  "Font " fontID + fontID ‚ÜíGrob
next
```

## GXor

Superimposes a source graphic object onto a destination graphic object, which
can be `Pict` to represent what is presently shown on screen. The upper left
corner pixel of the positioned at the specified coordinate in the destination.

`GXor` is used for creating cursors, for example, to make the cursor image
appear dark on a light background and light on a dark background. Executing
`Gxor` again with the same image restores the original picture.

`GXOR` uses a logical exclusive OR to determine the state of the pixels (on or
off) in the overlapping portion of the argument graphics objects.

If the destination is not `Pict`, the resulting graphic object is returned on
the stack. If the destination is `Pict`, the screen is updated and no result
is returned on the stack.

```rpl
@ Blinking cursor
"Hello" 1 DISP
1 20 start
  Pict { #0 #0 } "‚ñà" 3 ‚ÜíGrob GXor 0.5 Wait
next
```


## GOr

Superimposes a source graphic object onto a destination graphic object, which
can be `Pict` to represent what is presently shown on screen. The upper left
corner pixel of the positioned at the specified coordinate in the destination.

`GOr` uses a logical OR to determine the state of the pixels (on or
off) in the overlapping portion of the argument graphics objects.
On DB48X, pixels that are set appear white.

If the destination is not `Pict`, the resulting graphic object is returned on
the stack. If the destination is `Pict`, the screen is updated and no result
is returned on the stack.

```rpl
@ Erasing cursor
"Hello World" 1 DISP
1 50 for i
  Pict i R‚ÜíB { #0 } + "‚ñ∂" 3 ‚ÜíGrob GOr 0.05 Wait
next
```

## GAnd

Superimposes a source graphic object onto a destination graphic object, which
can be `Pict` to represent what is presently shown on screen. The upper left
corner pixel of the positioned at the specified coordinate in the destination.

`GAnd` uses a logical AND to determine the state of the pixels (on or
off) in the overlapping portion of the argument graphics objects.
On DB48X, pixels that are set appear white.

If the destination is not `Pict`, the resulting graphic object is returned on
the stack. If the destination is `Pict`, the screen is updated and no result
is returned on the stack.

```rpl
@ Darkening cursor

## Header

The `Header` command updates a special variable also called `Header`.

When that variable is present, it must evaluate to something that can render
graphically, either directly a graphic object or a (possibly multi-line) text.

When a header is provided, the normal content of the header, i.e. date, time and
name of the state file, is no longer shown.  However, annunciators and battery
status are still overimposed.

It is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that the header program
does not draw important data at these locations, and also to make sure that the
header program is "well behaved", i.e. does not leave things on stack. If the
header program generates an error, then that error may get in the way of normal
calculator operations.

# Operations with data

Data in RPL is generally represented using lists, such as `{ {1 2 } 3 "A"}`.
Numerical data can be represented using arrays, such as `[1 2 3 4]`. In the
DB48X implementation of RPL, arrays and list can have any number of dimensions,
and are not necessarily rectangular, although some operations (e.g. matrix
operations using arrays as input) can impose stricter constraints.


## ‚ÜíList

Build a list from elements on the stack. Level 1 of the stack contains the
number of elements in the list. The elements are on the stack, the first element
being deepest in the stack. This is the opposite of [List‚Üí](#fromlist).

`A` `B` ... `Count` ‚ñ∂ `{ A B ... }`

## List‚Üí

Expand a list on the stack and return the number of elements. After executing
the command, level 1 contains the number of elements, and a corresponding number
of stack levels contain individual elements of the list, the first element being
at the deepest level in the stack. This is the opposite of [‚ÜíList](#tolist). The
[Obj‚Üí](#explode) command performs the same operation when applied to a list.

`{ A B ... }` ‚ñ∂ `A` `B` ... `Count`


## List‚Üí

Expand a list on the stack and return the number of elements. After executing
the command, level 1 contains the number of elements, and a corresponding number
of stack levels contain individual elements of the list, the first element being
at the deepest level in the stack. This is the opposite of [‚ÜíList](#tolist). The
[Obj‚Üí](#fromobj) command performs the same operation when applied to a list.

`{ A B ... }` ‚ñ∂ `A` `B` ... `Count`

## Head

Return the first element of a list, or an `Invalid dimension` error if the list
is empty.

`{ A B ... }` ‚ñ∂ `A`

## Tail

Return all but the first element of a list, or an `Invalid dimension` error if
the list is empty.

`{ A B ... }` ‚ñ∂ `{ B ... }`

## Map

Apply an operation on all elements in a list or array. The operation on the
first level of the stack should take one argument and return a single value.

`{ A B ... }` `F` ‚ñ∂ `{ F(A) F(B) ... }`

## Reduce

Apply a cumulative pairwise operation on all elements in a list or array.
The operation on the first level of the stack should take two arguments and
combine them into a single value. The result is the repeated application of that
operation to all elements.

`{ A B ... }` `F` ‚ñ∂ `F(F(A, B), ...)`


## Filter

Filter elements in a list of array based on a predicate. The predicate given on
level 1 of the stack takes a value as argument, and returns a truth values. The
resulting list is built with all elements where the predicate is true.

`{ A B ... }` `P` ‚ñ∂ `{ A ... }` if `P(A)` is true and `P(B)` is false.


## Get

Get an element from composite data, such as list, an array or a text.
Elements are numbered starting at 1. The index can itself be a list, which is
interpreted as successive indices in the data.

For example,
`{ A B C } 2 GET` returns `B`,
`"ABC" 3 GET` returns `"C"`,
`[ [ 1 2 ] [ 4 5 ] [ 5 6 ] ] { 2 2 } GET` returns `5`.

When the data is a name, data is feched directly from the given named variable.

`Data` `Index` ‚ñ∂ `Element`


## Put

Put an element into composite data, such as list, an array or a text.
This performs the opposite operation compared to `Get`.

Elements are numbered starting at 1. The index can itself be a list, which is
interpreted as successive indices in the data.

For example,
`{ A B C } 2 'X' PUT` returns `{ A X C }`,
`"ABC" 2 "Hello" PUT` returns `"AHelloC"`,
`[ [ 1 2 ] [ 4 5 ] [ 5 6 ] ] { 2 2 } 7 PUT` returns `[ [ 1 2 ] [4 7 ] [5 6] ]`.

When the data is a name, data is feched directly from the given named variable.

`Data` `Index` ‚ñ∂ `Element`


## Sort

Sort elements in a list or array, sorting by increasing values when comparing
numers, text or symbols.

This may be a little slower than `QuickSort`, but is useful to sort
lists or arrays of numerical values or text values.

## QuickSort

Sort elements in a list or array using the memory representation of objects.
This guarantees a consistent sorting order, but one that does not necessarily
preserve numerical or textual properties, unlike `Sort`. Comparisons are,
however, significantly faster than `Sort`.

## ReverseSort

Sort a list or array by value, in reverse order compared to `Sort`.

## ReverseQuickSort

Sort a list or array using the memory representation of objects, in reverse
order compared to `QuickSort`.

## ReverseList

Reverse the order of elements in a list


## ADDROT
Add elements to a list, keep only the last N elements


## SEQ
Assemble a list from results of sequential procedure
# Operations with Matrices and vectors

## ToArray

Stack to Array Command: Returns a vector of n real or complex elements or a
matrix of n √ó m real or complex elements.

The elements of the result array should be entered in row order.

`A1` ... `An` `n` ‚ñ∂ `[ A1 ... An ]`

`A11` ... `Arc` `{ r c }` ‚ñ∂ `[[ A11 A1c] [ A21 ... Arc ]]`


## FromArray

Array to Stack Command: Takes an array and returns its elements as separate real or complex numbers. Also returns a list of the dimensions of the array.
If the argument is an n-element vector, the first element is returned to level n + 1 (not level nm + 1), and the nth element to level 2.

`[ A1 ... An ]`  ‚ñ∂ `A1` ... `An` `n`

`[[ A11 A1c] [ A21 ... Arc ]]`  ‚ñ∂ `A11` ... `Arc` `{ r c }`

## ConstantArray

Returns a constant array, defined as an array whose elements all have the same
value.

The constant value is an object taken from argument 2/level 1. The resulting
array is either a new array, or an existing array with its elements replaced by
the constant, depending on the object in argument 1/level 2.

* Creating a new array: If level 2 contains a list of one or two integers, `CON`
  returns a new array. If the list contains a single integer `n`, `CON` returns
  a constant vector with `n` elements. If the list contains two integers `n` and
  `m`, `CON` returns a constant matrix with `n` rows and `m` columns.

* Replacing the elements of an existing array: If level 2 contains an array,
  `CON` returns an array of the same dimensions, with each element equal to the
  constant.

* If level 2 contains a name, the name must identify a variable that contains a
  valid input for `con`, such as an array. In this case, the content of the
  variable is replaced with the value generated by `CON`

with its diagonal elements equal to 1 and its off-diagonal elements equal to 0.

The result is either a new square matrix, or an existing square matrix with its
elements replaced by the elements of the identity matrix, according to the
argument.

* Creating a new matrix: If the argument is an integer `n`, a new real identity
  matrix is returned, with its number of rows and number of columns equal to
  `n`.

* Replacing the elements of an existing matrix: If the argument is a square
  matrix, an identity matrix of the same dimensions is returned.

* Generating the identity matrix for a vector: If the argument is a vector with
  `n` elements, an identity matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns is created.

* If the argument is a name, the name must identify a variable containing on of the valid inputs. In this case, it is replaced with the result.

## Catalog

The `Catalog` command is triggered by the `+` command while in _Alpha_ mode, or
using üü® _+_ otherwise (_CAT_). It is an auto-completing catalog of all the
available commands or characters.

When entering a program, all commands matching the text currently matched will
be shown. For example, if you typed `A`, all commands containing an `A` are
displayed in alphabetical order. If you type ` ACO `, ` ACOS `, ` ACOSH ` and
` DataColumn ` (a possible spelling for ` ColŒ£ `) will all be shown.

Inside text, all characters related to the last entered character will be shown.
For example, if you typed `A`, options to add accents to `A` or to select the
Greek `Œ±` or the related `¬™` character. If no matching character is found,
the `CharactersMenu` is presented, allowing you to select specific characters
from predefined categories.


## CharactersMenu

The `CharactersMenu`, which can be accessed using üü¶ _2_ (_CHAR_), presents a
convenient way to insert characters.

While entering text, the [Catalog](#Catalog) also presents matching characters,
or the characters menu if none is found.

The characters menus and the catalog behaviour can be configured by modifying
the `config/characters.csv` file. Each row in that file contains two texts:

* The first is the name of the menu. If the name is empty, the menu is not
  shown, but is used to find characters related to a given character.

* The second is the list of characters to be shown.

Some language-specific submenus in the characters menu enable *transliteration*,
which select alphabetic characters in that language. For example, if you use the
character menu for Greek and lowercase, then typing `A` will insert
`Œ±` (greek lowercase alpha). Repeated use of the same key cycles through
options, in that case `Œ¨` and `a` before cycling back to `Œ±`.


## ConstantsMenu

The `ConstantsMenu` gives access to numerous [constants](#constants), shown in
various categories. This includes basic mathematical constants such as `œÄ` or
`e`, as well as constants related to chemistry, physics, computer science or
history.

The constants menu is defined by the `config/constants.csv` file. You are
encouraged to tailor this file to suit your own needs.


## ToggleCustomMenu

The `ToggleCustomMenu` command toggles between the `VariablesMenu` and the
`CustomMenu`. It is normally bound to the _VAR_ key, so that a first press on
this key shows the variables in the current directory, and a second press shows
any user-defined custom menu if it exists.


## CustomMenu

The `CustomMenu` command activates a menu defined by the variable of the same
name. The content of the variable should evaluate as an array or list, where
each item is either an array or list of the form `{ Name Value }`, or an object
that is made directly accessible in the menu. See `Menu` below for a description
of the format of menu descriptions.

The `Menu` command defines the `CustomMenu` variable and shows the corresponding
custom menu.


## Menu

This command shows up a system menu or defines a custom menu.

If the object on the stack is a menu name, typically returned by `RecallMenu`,
then `Menu` will activate that menu.

If the object on the stack is `0`, then `Menu` has the same effect as
`LastMenu`, showing the last menu selected. Other numerical values, which select
built-in menus on HP's implementation, will cause an `Unimplemented` error.

If the object on the stack is an array or a list, `Menu` will use that array or
list to set the value of the `CutomMenu` variable, and then behave like the
`CustomMenu` command, i.e. show the menu defined by the list.

The following defines a `CustomMenu` adding or subtracting powers of `10`

```rpl
{ { "1+"   ¬´   1 + ¬ª } { "1-"   ¬´   1 - ¬ª }
  { "10+"  ¬´  10 + ¬ª } { "10-"  ¬´  10 - ¬ª }
  { "100+" ¬´ 100 + ¬ª } { "100-" ¬´ 100 - ¬ª } }
MENU
```

You can define a menu of vertically-stacked menu items using a matrix.
For example, you can define a menu that lets you store, evaluate or purge
variables `X` and `Y as follows:

```rpl
[ [ X                      Y                      ]
  [ { ">X" ¬´ 'X' Store ¬ª } { ">Y" ¬´ 'Y' Store ¬ª } ]
  [ { "-X" ¬´ 'X' Purge ¬ª } { "-Y" ¬´ 'Y' Purge ¬ª } ] ]
MENU
```

## TMenu

The `TMenu` command works like [Menu](#menu), but does not define the
`CustomMenu` variable. The resulting menu is temporary and cannot be found by
`RecallMenu` or by the menu history in `LastMenu`.

For example, the following defines a temporary menu showing

```rpl
{ 2 3 5 7 11 13 97 197 397 797 997 1097 1297 1597 1697 1997 2297 2797 }
TMENU
```


## RecallMenu

Return the last menu entry, or `0` if there is no current menu. The returned
value can be used as an argument to `Menu` or `TMenu`.
# Numerical functions

## Integrate

Perform a numerical integration of a function for a specified variable on a
numerical interval. For example `2 3 'X*(X-3)' 'X' Integrate` returns `-7/6`.

The function takes four arguments:

* The lower bound of the integration range
* The higher bound of the integration range
* The program or expression to evaluate
* The integration variable

### IntegrationImprecision

This setting defines the relative imprecision for the result with respect to the
[Precision](#precision) setting. The default value is `6`, which means that at
the default precision of `24` digits, `Integrate` will try to compute to an
accuracy of 18 digits.

### IntegrationIterations

This setting limits the number of iterations for the integration algorithm. Each
iteration requires the evaluation of twice as many samples of the function to
integrate as the previous one, so the maximum number of samples taken is in the
order of `2^IntegrationIterations`.


## Root

Root-finder command. Returns a real number that is a value of the specified
variable for which the specified program or algebraic object most nearly
evaluates to zero or a local extremum. For example, `'X^2=3' 'X' 0` returns
`X:1.732050807568877293527446341953458`.

The function takes three arguments:

* The program or expression to evaluate
* The variable to solve for
* An initial guess, or a list containing an upper and lower guess.
# Objects

## Cycle

Cycle through various representations of the object on the first level of the stack.

* Polar <-> Rectangular for complex numbers
* Decimal <-> Fraction
* Integer <-> Based (cycles through the 2, 8, 10 and 16 base)
* Array <-> List <-> Program
* Text <-> Symbol

For unit objects, `Cycle` will cycle through all SI prefixes such that the
decimal representations fits within the `StandardExponent` range (i.e. that
would not display in scientific mode), increasing the numerical value, and then
switch the value to a fraction and cycle through all fraction representations
that fit within the same numerical range.

For example, if the `StandardExponent` is set to `6`, the value `0.1_m` will
cycle as follows:

* `0.1_m` being a decimal, we move to next scale up as decimal
* `1._dm`
* `10._cm`
* `100._mm`
* `100000._Œºm`, which is the limit of what can be displayed with 6 digits, so we
  switch to a fractional representation.
* `100000_Œºm` being a fraction, we go through the prefixes going down.
* `100_mm`
* `10_cm`
* `1_dm`
* `1/10_m`
* `1/100_dam`
* `1/1000_hm`
* `1/10000_km`, at which point the conversion would be out of range, so we
  switch back to decimal.
* `0.0001_km`
* `0.001_hm`
* `0.01_dam`
* `0.1_m` at which point the cycle repeats.


## Explode

Explode an object into its sub-components. The various sub-components are placed
on the stack, and if necessary, information about the size is places on the
first level of the stack.

* Complex numbers are split into real and imaginary part (for rectangular form)
  or modulus and argument (for polar form). The latter is an extension compared
  to classical RPL, which always represent complex numbers in rectangular form.

* Unit objects are split into the value and unit expression. This is a deviation
  from standard RPL, which places a unit object on the first level of the stack.

* Lists, programs and expressions are split into their individual components,
  and the number of components is placed on the first level of the stack. For
  programs, this is an extension of standard RPL. For expressions, this is a
  deviation: HP calculators instead place only the top level object and
  the arity.

* Arrays and vectors are split into their individual components, and the number
  of elements is placed as a list on the first level of the stack. The dimension
  list has one element for vectors, and two for matrices. If a given matrix is
  not rectangular, then the command reports an `Invalid dimension` error.

* Text is evaluated as if it had been executed on the command line, in a way
  similar to the `STR‚Üí` command.


## ‚ÜíProgram

Convert an object into a program.

* Algebraic expressions or polynomials are converted to an equivalent
  RPL program. For example, `'sin(X+2*Y)'` will be converted as
  `¬´ X 2 Y √ó + sin ¬ª`

* Lists are converted to a program with the exact same structure.
  For example, `{ 1 2 + }` will be converted to `¬´ 1 2 + ¬ª`.

* Other objects are simply wrapped in a program.
  For example, `1.2` will be converted to `¬´ 1.2 ¬ª`
  Note that this applies to programs as well.

Display numbers using full precision. All significant digts to the right of the
decimal separator are shown, up to 34 digits.

## FixedDisplay

Display numbers rounded to a specific number of decimal places.

## ScientificDisplay

Display numbers in scientific notation, i.e. with a mantissa and an
exponent. The mantissa has one digit to the left of the decimal separator and
shows the specified number of decimal places.

## EngineeringDisplay

Display nunmbers as a mantissa with a sepcified number of digits, followed by an
exponent that is a multiple of 3.

## SignificantDisplay

Display up to the given number of digits without trailing zero. This mode is
useful because DB48X can compute with large precision, and it may be useful to
not see all digits. `StndardDisplay` is equivalent to `34 SignificantDisplay`,
while `12 SignificantDisplay` should approximate the HP48 standard mode using
12 significant digits.

## StandardExponent

Select the maximum exponent before switching to scientific notation. The default value is 9, meaning that display uses scientific notation for exponents outside of -9..9.

## MinimumSignificantDigits

Select the minimum number of significant digits before switching to scientific
notation in `FIX` and `SIG` mode. The default value is `3`, meaning that at
least 3 significant digits will be shown.

A value of 0 is similar to how HP calculators before the HP Prime perform. For
example, with `2 FIX`, the value `0.055` will display as `0.06`, and `0.0055`
will display as `0.01`.

A higher value will switch to scienfic mode to show at least the given number of
digits. For instance, with `2 FIX`, if the value is `1`, then `0.055` will still
display as `0.06` but `0.0055` will display as `5.50E-3`. If the value is `2`,
then `0.055` will display as `5.5E-2`. A setting of `1` correspond to what the
HP Prime does.

A value of `-1` indicates that you do not want `FIX` mode to ever go to
scientific notation for negative exponents. In that case, `0.00055` will display
as `0.00`. This corresponds to how older HP calculators render numbers.


## TrailingDecimal

Display a trailing decimal separator to distinguish decimal from integer types. With this setting, `1.0` will display as `1.`. This can be disabled with [NoTrailingDecimal](#NoTrailingDecimal).


## NoTrailingDecimal

Hide the trailing decimal separator for decimal values with no fractional part. In that mode, `1.0` and `1` will both display identically, although the internal representation is different, the former being a floating-point value while the latter is an integer value.

## FancyExponent

Display the exponent in scientific mode using a fancy rendering that is visually similar to the normal mathematical notation.

## ClassicExponent

Display the exponent in scientific mode in a way reminiscent of classical HP48 calculators, for example `1.23E-4`.

## LeadingZero

Display a leading zero for fractional decimal values, i.e. display `0.5` and not
`.5`. This corresponds to the way most HP calculators display decimal values,
with the notable exception of RPL calculators in ` STD ` mode.

## NoLeadingZero

Do not display the leading zero for fractional decimal values, i.e. display `.5`
and not `0.5`. This corresponds to the way HP RPL calculators display numbers in
` STD ` mode.

## MixedFractions

Display fractions as mixed fractions when necessary, e.g. `3/2` will show up as `1 1/2`.

## ImproperFractions

Display fractions as improper fractions, e.g. `3/2` will show up as `3/2` and not `1 1/2`.

## SmallFractions

Show fractions using smaller characters, for example `¬π¬≤/‚ÇÑ‚ÇÉ`

## BigFractions

Show fractions using regular characters, for example `12/43`

## ModernBasedNumbers

Display based numbers using the modern DB48x syntax, i.e. `#12AB‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ` for
hexadecimal on the stack, and `16#12AB` on the command line.
This is the opposite of `CompatibleBasedNumbers`.

## CompatibleBasedNumbers

Display based numbers using the HP syntax, i.e. `#12ABh` for hexadecimal.
This is the opposite of `ModernBasedNumbers`.

# Angle settings

The angle mode determines how the calculator interprets angle arguments and how
it returns angle results.

DB48X has four angle modes:

* [Degrees](#Degrees): A full circle is 360 degress
* [Radians](#Radians): A full circle is 2œÄ radians
* [Grads](#Grads): A full circle is 400 radians
* [PiRadians](#PiRadians): Radians shown as multiple of œÄ

## Degrees

Select degrees as the angular unit. A full circle is 360 degrees.

## Radians

Select radians as the angular unit. A full circle is 2œÄ radians,
and the angle is shown as a numerical value.

## Grads

Select grads as the angular unit. A full circle is 400 grads.

## PiRadians

Select multiples of œÄ as the angular unit. A full circle is 2œÄ radians,
shown as a multiple of œÄ.

## SetAngleUnits

When this setting is active, inverse trigonometric functoins `asin`, `acos` and
`atan` return a unit value with a unit corresponding to the current `AngleMode`.
This makes it possible to have values on the stack that preserve the angle mode
they were computed with. The opposite setting is `NoAngleUnits`.

Note that the `sin`, `cos` and `tan` will copmute their value according to the
unit irrespective of this setting. In other words, `30_¬∞ SIN` will always give
`0.5`, even when computed in `Rad` or `Grad` mode,

## NoAngleUnits

This is the opposite setting to `SetAngleUnits`. Inverse trigonometric functions
behave like on the original HP-48 calculator, and return a numerical value that
depends on the current angle mode.


# Command display

DB48X can display commands either using a short legacy spelling, usually
identical to what is used on the HP-48 series of calculators, or use an
alternative longer spelling. For example, the command to store a value in a
variable is called `STO` in the HP-48, and can also be spelled `Store` in DB48X.

Commands are case insensitive, and all spellings are accepted as input
irrespective of the display mode.

DB48X has four command spelling modes:

* [Lowercase](#LowerCase): Display ` sto `
* [Uppercase](#UpperCase): Display ` STO `
* [Capitalized](#Capitalized): Display ` Sto `
* [LongForm](#LongForm): Display ` Store `

There are four parallel settings for displaying a variable name such as
`varName`:

* [LowercaseNames](#LowerCaseNames): Display as ` varname `
* [UppercaseNames](#UpperCaseNames): Display as ` VARNAME `
* [CapitalizedNames](#CapitalizedNames): Display as ` VarName `
* [LongFormNames](#LongFormNames): Display as ` varName `


## LowerCase

Display comands using the short form in lower case, for example `sto`.

## UpperCase

Display comands using the short form in upper case, for example `STO`.

## Capitalized

Display comands using the short form capitalized, for example `Sto`.

## LongForm

Display comands using the long form, for example `Store`.

## LowerCaseNames

Display names using the short form in lower case, for example `varName` will show as `varname`.

## UpperCase

Display names using the short form in upper case, for example `varName` will show as `VARNAME`.

## Capitalized

Display names using the short form capitalized, for example `varName` will show as `VarName`.

## LongForm

Display names using the long form, for example `varName` will show as `varName`.

# Decimal separator settings

The decimal separator can be either a dot (`1.23`) or a comma (`1,23`).

## DecimalDot

Select the dot as a decimal separator, e.g.  `1.23`

## DecimalComma

Select the comma as a decimal separator, e.g.  `1,23`

# Precision settings

## Precision

Set the default computation precision, given as a number of decimal digits. For
example, `7 Precision` will ensure at least 7 decimal digits for computation,
and `1.0 3 /` will compute `0.3333333` in that case.

DB48X supports an arbitrary precision for [decimal numbers](#decimal-numbers),
limited only by memory, performance and the size of built-in constants needed
for the computation of transcendental functions.

## SolverImprecision

Set the number of digits that can be ignored when solving. The default value is
6, meaning that if the current precision is 24, we only solve to an accuracy of
18 digits (i.e. 24-6).

# Base settings

Integer values can be reprecended in a number of different bases:

* [Binary](#Binary) is base 2
* [Ocgtal](#Octal) is base 8
* [Decimal](#Decimal) is base 10
* [Hexadecimal](#Hexadecimal) is base 16

## Binary

Selects base 2

## Octal

Selects base 8

## Decimal

Selects base 10

## Hexadecimal

Selects base 16

## Base

Select an arbitrary base for computations

## WordSize

Store the current [word size](#wordsize) in bits. The word size is used for
operations on based numbers. The value must be greater than 1, and the number of
bits is limited only by memory and performance.

## RecallWordSize

Return the current [word size](#wordsize) in bits.

## STWS

`STWS` is a compatibility spelling for the [WordSize](#wordsize) command.

## RCWS

`RCWS` is a compatibility spelling for the [RecallWordSize](#recallwordsize)
command.

## MaxRewrites

Defines the maximum number of rewrites in an equation.

[Equations rewrites](#rewrite) can go into infinite loops, e.g. `'X+Y' 'A+B'
'B+A' rewrite` can never end, since it keeps rewriting terms. This setting
indicates how many attempts at rewriting will be done before erroring out.

## MaxNumberBits

Define the maxmimum number of bits for numbers.

Large integer operations can take a very long time, notably when displaying them
on the stack. With the default value of 1024 bits, you can compute `100!` but
computing `200!` will result in an error, `Number is too big`. You can however
compute it seting a higher value for `MaxNumberBits`, for example
`2048 MaxNumberBits`.

This setting applies to integer components in a number. In other words, it
applies separately for the numerator and denominator in a fraction, or for the
real and imaginary part in a complex number. A complex number made of two
fractions can therefore take up to four times the number of bits specified by
this setting.

## ‚ÜíQIterations

Define the maximum number of iterations converting a decimal value to a
fraction. For example, `1 ‚ÜíFracIterations 3.1415926 ‚ÜíFrac` will give `22/7`,
whereas `3 ‚ÜíFracIterations 3.1415926 ‚ÜíFrac` will give `355/113`.

## ‚ÜíQDigits

Define the maximum number of digits of precision converting a decimal value to a
fraction. For example, `2 ‚ÜíFracDigits 3.1415926 ‚ÜíFrac` will give `355/113`.


# User interface

Various user-interface aspects can be customized, including the appearance of
Soft-key menus. Menus can show on one or three rows, with 18 (shifted) or 6
(flat) functions per page, and there are two possible visual themes for the
labels, rounded or square.

## ThreeRowsMenus

Display menus on up to three rows, with shift and double-shift functions showns
above the primary menu function.

## SingleRowMenus

Display menus on a single row, with labels changing using shift.

## FlatMenus

Display menus on a single row, flattened across multiple pages.

## RoundedMenu

Display menus using rounded black or white tabs.

## SquareMenus

Display menus using square white tabs.

## CursorBlinkRate

Set the cursor blink rate in millisecond, between 50ms (20 blinks per second)
and 5000ms (blinking every 5 seconds).

## ShowBuiltinUnits

Show built-in units in the `UnitsMenu` even when a units file was loaded.

## HideBuiltinUnits

Hide built-in units in the `UnitsMenu` when a units file was loaded.
The built-in units will still show up if the units file fails to load.

## MultiLineResult

Show the result (level 1 of the stack) using multiple lines.
This is the opposite of [SingleLineResult](#singlelineresult).
Other levels of the stack are controled by [MultiLineStack](#multilinestack)

## SingleLineResult

Show the result (level 1 of the stack) on a single line.
This is the opposite of [MultiLineResult](#multilineresult).
Other levels of the stack are controled by [SingleLineStack](#singlelinestack)

## MultiLineStack

Show the levels of the stack after the first one using multiple lines.
This is the opposite of [SingleLineStack](#singlelinestack).
Other levels of the stack are controled by [MultiLineResult](#multilineresult)

## SingleLineStack

Show the levels of the stack after the first one on a single line
This is the opposite of [MultiLineStack](#multilinestack).
Other levels of the stack are controled by [SingleLineResult](#singlelineresult)

## GraphicResultDisplay

Display the first level of the stack (result) using a graphical representations
for objects such as expressions or matrices. Note that enabling this setting may
increase CPU utilization and reduce battery life compared to text-only
rendering.

This is the opposite of [TextResultDisplay](#textresultdisplay)

## TextResultDisplay

Display the first level of the stack (result) using a text-only representations.

This is the opposite of [TextResultDisplay](#textresultdisplay)

## GraphicStackDisplay

Display the stack levels above the first one using a graphical representations
for objects such as expressions or matrices. Note that enabling this setting may
increase CPU utilization and reduce battery life compared to text-only
rendering.

This is the opposite of [TextStackDisplay](#textstackdisplay)

## TextStacktDisplay

Display the stack levels above the first one using a text-only representations.

This is the opposite of [GraphicStackDisplay](#graphicstackdisplay)

## AutoScaleStack

When using [graphic result display](#graphicresultdisplay), automatically scale
down the font size in order to make stack elements fit. Enabling this setting
may increase CPU utilization and reduce battery life compared to fixed-size
rendering.

This is the opposite of [NoStackAutoScale](#nostackautoscale).


## NoStackAutoScale

When using [graphic result display](#graphicresultdisplay), do not automatically
scale down the font size in order to make stack elements fit.

This is the opposite of [AutoScaleStack](#autoscalestack).

## MaximumShowWidth

Maximum number of horizontal pixels used to display an object with
[Show](#show).

## MaximumShowHeight

Maximum number of vertical pixels used to display an object with [Show](#show).

## EditorWrapColumn

Wrapping occurs at the end of an object, not in the middle of it.

## TabWidth

Width of a tab in the editor, in pixels.

## ExitKeepsMenu

By default, the `EXIT` key clears the current menu if not editing.
When `ExitKeepsMenu` is set, the `EXIT` key does not clear the menu.

## ExitClearsMenu

Restore the default behaviour where `EXIT` clears the current menu when not
editing.

## ShowEmptyMenu

Show empty menu entries. For example, when selecting the `VariablesMenu` and
there is no variable defined, an empty menu shows up.

## HideEmptyMenu.

Restore the default behaviour where empty menus entries are not shown, leaving
more space for the stack display.


# Statistics settings

## LinearFitSums

When this setting is active, statistics functions that return sums, such as
`Œ£XY` or `Œ£X¬≤`, operate without any adjustment to the data, i.e. as if the
fitting model in `Œ£Parameters` was `LinearFit`.

## CurrentFitSums

When this setting is active, statistics functions that return sums, such as
`Œ£XY` or `Œ£X¬≤`, will adjust their input according to the current fitting model
in special variable `Œ£Parameters`, in the same way as required for
`LinearRegression`.

## RandomGeneratorBits

Define the number of random bits generated by ACORN random number generator,
between 32 and 4096 bits. The default value is 128 bits. A lower value uses less
memory and accelerates computations, but some digits in the resulting numbers
may not be adequately random. Conversely, a higher value increases true
randomness in the resulting numbers and should be used if you need random
numbers with higher [Precision](#precision) than the default 24 digits.

For example, with a value of 64, the generated random numbers will very often
contain zeros after the 12th digit. The reason is that 64 bits of randomness
corresponds to only 20 digits, which is less than the default 24-digits
precision of DB48X.


## RandomGeneratorOrder

Define the order of the ACORN random number generator, i.e. the value called `k`
in the ACORN documentation. This is the number of seed numbers preserved between
generations. A higher value requires more memory and takes more time to compute
but generates higher-quality random numbers. On DB48X, the ACORN order can be
set between 10 and 256. The default value is 32.


# Compatibility settings

Various settings control the compatibility of DB48X with various classes of HP calculators.

## DetailedTypes

The `Type` command returns detailed DB48X type values, which can distinguish
between all DB48X object types, e.g. distinguish between polar and rectangular
objects, or the three internal representations for decimal numbers. Returned
values are all negative, which distinguishes them from RPL standard values, and
makes it possible to write code that accepts both the compatible and detailed
values.

This is the opposite of [CompatibleTypes](#compatibletypes).

## CompatibleTypes

The `Type` command returns values as close to possible to the values documented
on page 3-262 of the HP50G advanced reference manual. This is the opposite of
[NativeTypes](#nativetypes).


## NumberedVariables

This flag enables numbered variables similar to what existed on earlier RPN calculators. For example, when the setting is active, `2.5 0 STO` stores the value 2.5 in numbered register `0`.

## NoNumberedVariables

This flag disables numbered variables, behaving closer to the way RPL calculators work. For example, when the setting is active, `2.5 0 STO` generates an `Invalid name` error.

## IgnoreSymbolCase

Ignore the case in symbols, i.e. variables `X` and `x` are the same.
Note that this is different from the way RPL in HP calculators works.

## DistinguishSymbolCase

Distinguish the case in symbols, i.e. variables `X` and `x` are distinct.
This is the way RPL in HP calculators works.


## ListAsProgram

When this setting is set, DB48X behaves like the HP48S and later HP devices and
evaluates lists as if they were programs. For example, `{ 1 2 + } EVAL` returns
`3`. The default is [ListsAsData](#listsasdata).

## ListsAsData

When this setting is set, DB48X behaves like the HP28 and evaluates lists as
data. For example, `{ 1 2 + } EVAL` returns `{ 1 2 + }`.


## KillOnError

An error kills the program without giving you the possibility to debug the
problem. If you want to debug, you need to start the program with `Debug` and
then use the `Continue` command.


## DebugOnError

An error during a program enters the debugger, letting you correct the problem
before resuming execution. This is the default setting.


## SaveLastArguments

Save last arguments when evaluating commands interactively.
This is disabled by `NoLastArguments`.

Saving arguments during program execution is controlled by a separate setting,
`ProgramLastArguments`.

## NoLastArguments

Disable the saving of last arguments when interactively evaluating commands.

## ProgramLastArguments

Save last arguments during program execution. This may impact performance,
and is disabled by default (`NoProgramLastArguments`).

## NoProgramLastArguments

Disable the saving of command arguments during program execution.
If `SaveLastArguments` is set, arguments to interactive commands will still be
saved.


# States

The calculator can save and restore state in files with extension `.48S`.
This feature is available through the `Setup` menu (Shift-`0`).

The following information is stored in state files:

* Global variables
* Stack contents
* Settings
# Numeric solvers

## NUMINT
Numerical integration (adaptive Simpson)


## ROOT

Find the root of an equation or of a system of equations.

'Expr' 'Var' 'Guess' ‚ñ∂ 'Solution'

The `Root` command takes an expression or an equation `Expr`, a variable `Var`
and an initial guess for the value `Guess`, and searches for a value of `Var`
that will zero the expression or verify the equation.

For example, to find the value of `x` where the value of `sin(x)` matches that
of `cos(x)/3` close to `1.5_¬∞`, use the following:

```rpl
'sin(x)=cos(x)/3'
'x' 0.5_¬∞ ROOT
@ Expecting x=18.43494‚Åü88229‚ÄÜ¬∞
```

### Guess range

The `Guess` can be given as a list or vector containing two values, in which
case the algorithm will first evaluate the two given values. Otherwise, it will
first evaluate the guess value and a value close to it.


### Unit management

Specifying a unit for the initial value forces the calculator to compute the result using the given unit.

In the example above, the guess was . Otherwise, the result would depend on the angle mode, e.g. in `Radians` mode:

```rpl
RAD
'sin(x)=cos(x)/3'
'x' 0.5 ROOT
@ Expecting x=0.32175‚Åü05543‚Åü97
```

### Algebraic form

Unlike the HP version, `ROOT` can be used as an algebraic function,
using a syntax similar to what is used in algebraic mode on the HP50G.

The previous example can be written in algebraic form as follows:

```rpl
'ROOT(sin(x)=cos(x)/3;x;1.5_¬∞)'
EVAL
@ Expecting x=18.43494‚Åü88229‚ÄÜ¬∞
```

### Solver (im)precision

The desired precision is given by the `SolverImprecision` setting relative to
the current `Precision` setting, allowing the solver to stop earlier. For
example, the default value `6` for `SolverImprecision`, combined with the
default 24-digit `Precision` means that the solver will seek 18-digit precision
(i.e. 24-6).

For example, the following will find a "solution" to `1/x=0` once it reaches the
desired precision:

```rpl
'ROOT(1/x;x;1)' EVAL
@Expect: :x:1.10008‚Åü77783‚Åü66101‚Åü93099‚Åü87‚Å≥18
```

### Updating global variables

Whether the solver found a solution or not, `Root` updates the value of the
target variable with the closest value it found so far. When no solution was
found, the value stored in the global variable is where the computed value was
the closest to zero, and is usually close to a local extremum.


### Finding complex solutions

If the guess value for the variable is a complex number, the DB48X version of
`ROOT` will explore the complex plane for solutions. This is an extension
compared to HP implementations of RPL.

For example, you can find a complex root for the following equation:
```rpl
'ROOT((X-5)¬≤+3;X;0+0‚Öà)'
@ Expecting X=5.+1.73205‚Åü08075‚Åü7‚Öà
```

### Differences with HP calculators

Since the root-finding algorithm is different in DB48X, there is no guarantee
that the numerical solver will find the same solution as HP calculators.

According to the HP50G Advanced Reference Manual, `ROOT` produces an error if it
cannot find a solution. However, experimentally, HP calculators will silently
return an extremum, whereas DB48X will indicate if it failed to find a
solution. For example, the following code returns a value close to 5 on HP48SX
or HP50G, but returns an error on DB48X, with the variable `X` containing a
value close to 5.

```rpl
@ Expecting "DB48X"
IFERR
 'sq(X-5)+3' 'X' 0 ROOT
THEN
 "DB48X"
ELSE
 "HP50G"
END
```

As an extension to the HP implementation, `ROOT` can solve systems of equations
and multiple variables by solving them one equation at a time, a programmatic version of what the HP50G Advanced Reference Manual calls the Multiple Equation Solver (`MINIT`, `MITM` and `MSOLVR` commands).

# Statistics

## RDZ

Initialize random number generator with a seed. If the given seed is zero, then
a truly random value based on the internal system clock is used, and the value
changes every millisecond.

For any given non-zero value, the sequence of numbers generated by
[RAND](#rand) or [Random](#random) will always be identical.


## RAND

Generate a random real number between 0 and 1, 1 being excluded.

DB48X uses an additive congruential random number generator (ACORN), which is
configured by two settings, [RandomGeneratorOrder](#randomgeneratororder) and
[RandomGeneratorBits](#randomgeneratorbits).


## Random

Generate a random number between two bounds.

If the two bounds are integers, then the result is an integer, and the upper
bound is included. For example, `2 4 Random` can generate `2`, `3` or `4`.

Otherwise, the upper bound is excluded. For example, `2. 4. Random` can generate
any number between `2.0` and `4.0`, but the upper bound `4.0` cannot be
generated.

The resulting number is

## Œ£Data (Œ£DAT)

The `Œ£Data` variable contains the statistics data, in the form of a matrix.

*Note*: The `Œ£Data` name is considered a command internally, and as such,
is subject to `CommandDisplayMode` and not `NamesDisplayMode`.

## Œ£Parameters (Œ£PAR)

The `Œ£Parameters` variable contains the statistics parameters, as a list with
five elements:

`{ xcol ycol intercept slope fit }`

The `xcol` value is an integer starting at 1, indicating the independent column.
The `ycol` value similarly indicates the dependent column.

The `intercept` and `slope` are the parameters for the linear regression.
The `fit` value is the type of fit being used:
(`LinFit`, `ExpFit`, `PwrFit`, `LogFit`);

*Note*: The `Œ£Parameters` name is considered a command internally, and as such,
is subject to `CommandDisplayMode` and not `NamesDisplayMode`.

## Œ£+

Add data to the statistics data array `Œ£Data`.

* If data is a real or complex number, statistics data is single-column

* If data is a vector, statistics data has the same number of columns as the
  size of the vector.

## Œ£-

Remove the last data entered in the statistics array, and pushes it on the stack.

`Œ£Data`. The values are adjusted according to the current fitting model defined
in `Œ£Parameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is active.

## Œ£Y

Return the sum of values in the `YCol` column of the statistics data array
`Œ£Data`. The values are adjusted according to the current fitting model defined
in `Œ£Parameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is active.

## Œ£XY

Return the sum of the product of values in the `XCol` and `YCol` columns of the
statistics data array `Œ£Data`. The values are adjusted according to the current
fitting model defined in `Œ£Parameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is
active.

## Œ£X¬≤

Return the sum of the squares of the values in the `XCol` column of the
statistics data array `Œ£Data`. The values are adjusted according to the current
fitting model defined in `Œ£Parameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is
active.

## Œ£Y¬≤

Return the sum of the squares of the values in the `YCol` column of the
statistics data array `Œ£Data`. The values are adjusted according to the current
fitting model defined in `Œ£Parameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is
active.

## Œ£Total

Returns the sum of all columns in the statistics data array `Œ£Data`.

## Variance

Calculates the sample variance of the coordinate values in each of the columns
in the current statistics matrix (`Œ£Data`).

## Correlation

Returns the correlation coefficient of the independent and dependent data
columns in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `Œ£Data`).

The columns are specified by the first two elements in the reserved variable
`Œ£Parameters`, set by `XCol` and `YCol`, respectively. If `Œ£Parameters` does not
exist, `Correlation` creates it and sets the elements to their default values
(1 and 2).

## Covariance

Returns the sample covariance of the independent and dependent data columns in
the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `Œ£Data`).

The columns are specified by the first two elements in the reserved variable
`Œ£Parameters`, set by `XCol` and `YCol`, respectively. If `Œ£Parameters` does not
exist, `Correlation` creates it and sets the elements to their default values
(1 and 2).

## StandardDeviation

Calculates the sample standard deviation of each of the columns of coordinate values in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `Œ£Data`).

`StandardDeviation`  returns a vector of numbers, or a single number there is only one column of data.

The standard deviation is the square root of the `Variance`.

## LinearRegression

Uses the currently selected statistical model to calculate the linear regression
coefficients (intercept and slope) for the selected dependent and independent
variables in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `Œ£Data`).

The columns of independent and dependent data are specified by the first two
elements in the reserved variable `Œ£Parameters`, set by `XCol` and `YCol`, respectively.
The default independent and dependent columns are 1 and 2.

The selected statistical model is the fifth element in `Œ£Parameters`.
LR stores the intercept and slope (untagged) as the third and fourth elements,
respectively, in `Œ£Parameters`.

The coefficients of the exponential (`ExpFit`), logarithmic (`LogFit`),
and power (`PwrFit`) models are calculated using transformations that allow
the data to be fitted by standard linear regression.

The equations for these transformations are:

* `LinFit`: `y = slope * x + intercept`
* `LogFit`: `y = slope * ln(x) + intercept`
* `ExpFit`: `y = intercept * exp(slope * x)`
* `PwrFit`: `y = intercept * x ^ slope`

where b is the intercept and m is the slope. The logarithmic model requires
positive x-values (XCOL), the exponential model requires positive y-values
(YCOL), and the power model requires positive x- and y-values.

## Intercept

Return the intercept value last computed by `LinearRegression`

This is a DB48X extension, not present on HP calculators

## Slope

Return the slope value last computed by `LinearRegression`

This is a DB48X extension, not present on HP calculators

## BestFit

Select the best linear regression mode based on current data, i.e. the
regression mode where the correlation value is the highest.

## LinearFit

Select linear fit, i.e. try to model data with a linear equation `y = a*x+b`.

## ExponentialFit

Select exponential fit, i.e. try to model data with an equation `y = b*exp(a*x)`

## LogarithmicFit

Select logarithmic fit, i.e. try to model data with an equation `y = a*ln(x)+b`.

## PowerFit

Select power fit, i.e. try to model data with an equation `y = x^a * b`.


## FrequencyBins

Sorts the elements of the independent column (`XCol`) of the current statistics
matrix (the reserved variable `Œ£Dat`) into (`nbins + 2`) bins, where the left
edge of bin 1 starts at value `xmin` and each bin has width `xwidth`.

`FrequencyBins` returns a matrix containing the frequency of occurrences in each
bin, and a 2-element array containing the frequency of occurrences falling below
or above the defined range of x-values. The array can be stored into the
reserved variable `Œ£Data` and used to plot a bar histogram of the bin data, for
example, by executing `BarPlot`.

`xmin` `xwidth` `nbins` ‚ñ∂ `[[ n1 .. n2 ]]` `[ nlow nhigh ]`


## PopulationVariance

Calculates the population variance of the coordinate values in each of the m
columns in the current statistics matrix (`Œ£Data`).

The population variance (equal to the square of the population standard
deviation) is returned as a vector of m real numbers, or as a single real number
if there is a single column of data.

## PopulationStandardDeviation

Calculates the population standard deviation of each of the m columns of
coordinate values in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `Œ£Data`).

The command returns a vector of m real numbers, or a single real number if there
is a single column of data.

## PopulationCovariance

Computes the population covariance of the independent and dependent data columns
in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `Œ£Data`).

The columns are specified by the first two elements in reserved variable
`Œ£Parameters`, set by `XCol` and `YCol` respectively. If `Œ£Parameters` does not
exist, `PCOV` creates it and sets the elements to their default values, 1 and 2.

## IndependentColumn

Set the independent variable column in the reserved variable `Œ£Parameters`.

`XCol` ‚ñ∂ (Update `Œ£Parameters`)

## DependentColumn

Set the dependent variable column in the reserved variable `Œ£Parameters`.

`YCol` ‚ñ∂ (Update `Œ£Parameters`)

## DataColumns

Set both the independent and dependent data columns in the reserved variable
`Œ£Parameters`.

`XCol` `YCol` ‚ñ∂ (Update `Œ£Parameters`)
# Operations with Symbolic Expressions

## ‚ÜëMatch

Match pattern up and [rewrite expression](#expression-rewrite), starting with
the innermost subexpressions first. This approach works well for
simplifications. A subexpression simplified during one execution will be a
simpler argument of its parent expression, so the parent expression can be
simplified further.

`Expr` { `From` `To` } ‚ñ∂ `Expr` `Count`
`Expr` { `From` `To` `Cond` } ‚ñ∂ `Expr` `Count`

The first argument `Expr` is the expression to transform.

The second argument is a list containing the pattern to match `From`,
the replacement pattern `To`,
and an optional condition `Cond` on the pattern.


## ‚ÜìMatch

Match pattern down and [rewrite expression](#expression-rewrite), starting with
the outermost expression first. This approach works well for expansion. An
expression expanded during one execution of `‚ÜìMatch` will contain additional
subexpressions, and those subexpressions can be expanded further.

`Expr` { `From` `To` } ‚ñ∂ `Expr` `Count`
`Expr` { `From` `To` `Cond` } ‚ñ∂ `Expr` `Count`

The first argument `Expr` is the expression to transform.

The second argument is a list containing the pattern to match `From`,
the replacement pattern `To`,
and an optional condition `Cond` on the pattern.

## Expression rewrite

Operations such as `‚ÜëMatch` and `‚ÜìMatch` apply arbitrary transformations on
algebraic expressions. The way this operates is similar to how HP
calculators perform, but with important differences, controlled by flags.

First, patterns can contain wildcards, which are substituted with the
corresponding sub-expression in the matched `Expr`.

* On HP calculators, the wildcard names must begin with `&`, and only an
  optional external conditions can control what matches or not.

* On DB48X, by default, any name in the pattern acts as a wildcard, and we use
  `&` to refer to a specific variable i.e. `&A` only matches the variable named
  `A`.

Rationale: The default DB48X approach makes it easier to write transformation
rules for the common cases, the `&` character being a bit harder to access on
the calculator's keyboard. The assumption is that we rarely write patterns to
match a specific variable, i.e. replace an expression only if it refers to `X`
but not to `Y`. The HP behaviour can be restored using the `ExplicitWildcards`
flag.

A further extension in DB48X is to give a semantic meaning to the first letter
of variable names:

* `a`, `b` and `c` denote numerical constants, like real or integer values.
* `i`, `j` are positive integer values which may be zero and may be the result
  of a computation, i.e. `3-3` will match.
* `k`, `l`, `m` are non-zero positive integer values, which may be the result of
  a compuation, i.e. `3-2` will match.
* `n`, `o`, `p` are symbols or names like `'ABC'`.
* `u`, `v`, `w` are unique terms, i.e. terms that cannot be presented more than
  once in an expression.
* Names where the initial is lowercase must be sorted, so that `x+y` will match
  `A+B` but not `B+A`.

Another important difference is that on HP calculators, the number of rewrites
of subexpressions is limited to a single pass, irrespective of flag `-100`
(step-by-step CAS mode), whereas DB48X will repeat application by default (this
can be changed by setting `StepByStepAlgebraResults`, or alternatively, by
clearing flag `-100`).

This leads to the last important difference. On HP calculators, `‚ÜëMatch` and
`‚ÜìMatch` return either `0` or `1` in the first level of the stack to indicate if
a replacement occurred. On DB48X, the number of replaced subexpressions is
returned, and it can be greater than 1.


Examples:
* `'A+B+0' {'X+0' 'X' } ‚ÜìMatch` returns `'A+B' 1`
* `'A+B+C' { 'X+Y' 'Y-X' } ‚ÜìMatch` returns `'C-(B-A)' 2`
* `'(A+B)^3' { 'X^N' 'X*X^(N-1)' } ‚ÜìMatch` returns `(A+B)*(A+B)^2`.


## Isolate

Isolate variable: Returns an expression that rearranges an expression given in
stack level 2 to ‚Äúisolate‚Äù a variable specified in stack level 1.

For example, `A+1=sin(X+B)+C' 'X' ISOL` will produce `X=sin‚Åª¬π(A-C+1)+2¬∑i1¬∑œÄ-B`.

When the `PrincipalSolution` flag is not set, the resulting expression may
contain numbered variables such as `i1` as parameters. Variables that begin with
`i` represent arbitrary signed integers. Variables that begin with `n` represent
arbitrary natural numbers. Variables that begin with `s` represent arbitrary
signs.

The command will generate `Unable to isolate` if the expression cannot be
reorganized, for example because it contains functions that have no known
inverse.

## Derivative

Compute the derivative function for an expression. The algebraic syntax for `‚àÇ` is `'‚àÇname(expr)'` For example, `'‚àÇx(sin(2*x^2)'` computes `4*X*cos(2*X^2)`

When differentiating a user-defined function named `F`, DB48X will generate `F‚Ä≤`
as the name for the derivative function. Note that this differ from HP
calculators, which would use `d1F`. If `F` has multiple parameters, then the
partial derivative relative to the first argument will be denoted as `F‚Ä≤‚ÇÅ`,
the partial derivative relative to the second argument will be denoted as
`F‚Ä≤‚ÇÇ` and so on.

For built-in functions that have no known derivative, such as `GAMMA`, DB48X
will generate an `Unknown derivative` error. Note that this differs from HP
calculators, which would generate a `d1GAMMA` function in that case.

The behaviour of the HP derivative function `‚àÇ` depends on whether it is in an
algebraic object (stepwise differentiation) or whether it is used in stack
syntax (full differentiation). The DB48X variant always perform full
differentiation irrespective of the syntax used.

The _HP50G advanced reference manual_ indicates that `‚àÇ` substitutes the value
of global variables. For example, if `Y` contains `X+3*X^2`, `'Y' 'X' ‚àÇ` is
expected to return `1+6*X`. It actually returns `0`, unless you evaluate `Y`
first. DB48X matches the actual behaviour of the HP50G and not the documented
one. To get the documented behaviour, evaluate the expression prior to computing
its derivative.


## AutoSimplify

Enable automatic reduction of numeric subexpressions according to usual
arithmetic rules. After evaluating `AutoSimplify` `'X+0`' will evaluate as `'X'`
and '`X*1-B*0'` witll evaluate as `'X'`.

The opposite setting is [NoAutoSimplify](#noautosimplify)

## NoAutoSimplify

Disable automatic reduction of numeric subexpressions according to usual
arithmetic rules. After evaluating `NoAutoSimplify`, equations such as`'X+0`'
or `X*1-B*0` will no longer be simplified during evaluation.

The opposite setting is [AutoSimplify](#autosimplify)


## FinalAlgebraResults

Evaluate algebraic rules on symbolic expressions repeatedly until no futher change results from applying them.


## StepByStepAlgebraResults

Evaluate algebraic rules on symbolic expressions one step at a time.



## ‚ÜíNum

Convert fractions and symbolic constants to decimal form.
For example, `1/4 ‚ÜíNum` results in `0.25`.

## ‚ÜíQ

Convert decimal values to fractions. For example `1.25 ‚ÜíFrac` gives `5/4`.
The precision of the conversion in digits is defined by
[‚ÜíFracDigits](#ToFractionDigits), and the maximum number of iterations for the
conversion is defined by [‚ÜíFracDigits](#ToFractionIterations)

## ListExpressionNames

List all variables used in an expression or polynomial, leaving the original
object on the stack, and returning the result as an array.
Names are sorted in decreasing order of size, and for the same size,
in alphabetical order.

`'A*Foo*G(X;Y;cos Z)`  ‚ñ∂ `'A*Foo*G(X;Y;cos Z)` `[ Foo A G X Y Z ]`
`'(U_V)=(I_A)*(R_Œ©)'`  ‚ñ∂ `'(U_V)=(I_A)*(R_‚Ñ¶)'` `[ I R U ]`

As a DB48X extension, this command also applies to programs, list and
arrays. Another extension is the `ExpressionVariables` command, which extracts
the units associated with the variables if there are any. The `LName` command
only returns the names, without the associated unit.


## ExpressionVariables

List all variables used in an expression or polynomial, returning the result as
a list.
Names are sorted in decreasing order of size, and for the same size,
in alphabetical order.
If there are units in the expression, the units are returned in the resulting
list.

`'A*Foo*G(X;Y;cos Z)`  ‚ñ∂ `{ Foo A G X Y Z }`
`'(U_V)=(I_A)*(R_Œ©)'`  ‚ñ∂ `{ (I_A) (R_‚Ñ¶) (U_V) }`

This is a variation of the HP command `LNAME`, which is a bit more convenient to
use in programs.

time, as in `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS`.

Note: the date format is intentionally different from the format on the HP-48.

## Time format

The time format is `HH.MMSS` with optional hundredths of a second as
in `HH.MMSSCC`.


## SetDate

Set current system date.

The date format is `YYYYMMDD`, with an optional fractional part defining the
time, as in `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS`. If the fractional part is zero, then the time is
not changed.

Note: the date format is intentionally different from the format on the HP-48.


## Date+

Add days to a [date](#date). The date format is `YYYYMMDD`, with an optional fractional part defining the time, as in `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS`, and an optional unit, as in `YYYMMDD_date`.


## SetTime

Set current time from a stack value `HH.MMSSCC`.

An HMS value can also be given, as returned by the `Time` command.


## ToHMS

Convert decimal time to `HH.MMSS` format.


## FomHMS

Convert time in `HH.MMSS` format to decimal time.


## HMS+

Add time in `HH.MMSS` format.


## HMS-

Subtract time in `HH.MMSS` format


## Ticks

Return system clock in milliseconds


## TEVAL
Perform EVAL and measure elapsed time


## Date

Return the current system date as a unit object in the form `YYYYMMDD_date`.
This displays on the stack according to date format settings, in a way similar
to what is shown in the header, e.g. `23/Feb/2024` or `2024-02-23`.


## DateTime

Return the current system date as a unit object in the form `YYYYMMDD_date`.
This displays on the stack according to date format settings, in a way similar
to what is shown in the header, e.g. `23/Feb/2024` or `2024-02-23`.

## DDays

Number of days between dates.


## Time

Return the current system time as a unit object in the form `HH.MMSS_hms`.
This displays on the stack as `HH:MM:SS`.

## TSTR


## JulianDayNumber

## FINDALARM
Get first alarm due after the given time


## Version

Return DB48X version information as text.

 ‚ñ∂ `"Version information"`


## FreeMemory

Return the number of bytes immediately available in memory, without performing a
cleanup of temporary values (garbage collection).

See also: [GarbageCollect](#GarbageCollect), [FreeMemory](#FreeMemory)


## AvailableMemory

Return the number of bytes available in memory.

*Remark*: The number returned is only a rough indicator of usable memory.
In particular, [recovery features](#LastThingsMenu) consume or release varying
amounts of memory with each operation.

Before it can assess the amount of memory available, `AvailableMemory` removes
objects in temporary memory that are no longer being used. Like on the HP48, you
can therfore use `MEM` `DROP` to force garbage collection. However, there is
also a dedicated command for that, [GarbageCollect](#GarbageCollect).

See also: [FreeMemory](#FreeMemory), [GarbageCollect](#GarbageCollect)


## GarbageCollect

Perform a clean-up of temporary objects and return number of bytes reclaimed.

In order to speed up normal operations, temporaries are only discarded when
necessary to make room. This clean-up process, also called *garbage collection*,
occurs automatically when memory is full. Since garbage collection can slow down
calculator operation at undesired times, you can force it to occur at a desired
time by executing [GarbageCollect](#GarbageCollect).

See also: [FreeMemory](#FreeMemory), [Purge](#Purge)

## GarbageCollectorStatistics

Return an array containing garbage collector statistics, including:

* The number of garbage collection cycles
* The total number of bytes collected
* The total time spent collecting garbage
* The number of bytes collected during the last collection cycle
* The time spent during the last collection cycle

## Bytes

Return the size of the object and a hash of its value. On classic RPL systems,
teh hash is a 5-nibbles CRC32. On DB48X, the hash is a based integer of the
current [wordsize](#stws) corresponding to the binary representation of the
object.

For example, the integer `7` hash will be in the form `#7xx`, where `7` is the
value of the integer, and `xx` represents the integer type, as returned by the
[Type](#type) command.

`X` ‚ñ∂ `Hash` `Size`


## Type

Return the type of the object as a numerical value. The value is not guaranteed
to be portable across versions of DB48X (and pretty much is guarantteed to _not_
be portable at the current stage of development).

If the `CompatibleTypes` setting is active, the returned value roughly matches
the value returned by the HP50G. It always returns `29` for arrays, not `3`
(real array) nor `4` (complex array). It returns `1` for both polar and
rectangular complex numbers, irrespective of their precision. 128-bit decimal
values return `21` (extended real), 32-bit and 64-bit return `0` (real number).
The separation between `18` (built-in function) and `19` (built-in command) may
not be accurate.

If the `DetailedTypes` setting is active, the return value is negative, and
matches the internal representation precisely. For example, distinct values will
be returned for fractions and expressions.

*Note* The [TypeName](#typename) command returns the type as text, and
this is less likely to change from one release to the next. DB48X-only code
should favor the use of `TypeName`, both for portability and readability.

## TypeName

Return the [type](#Type) of the object as text. For example, `12 type` returns
`"integer"`.


## PEEK
Low-level read memory address


## POKE
Low level write to memory address


## NEWOB
Make a new copy of the given object


## USBFWUPDATE


## PowerOff

Turn calculator off programmatically


## SystemSetup

Display the built-in system setup


## SaveState

Save the machine's state to disk, using the current state if one was previously
loaded. This is intended to quickly save the state for example before a system
upgrade.


## ScreenCapture

Capture the current state of the screen in a dated file stored on the flash storage under the `SCREENS/` directory. This is activated by *holding* üü® and _O_ simultaneously. Pressing the keys one after another activates the [DisplayMenu](#displaymenu).
# Tagged objects

Tagged objects are a way to indicate what a value represents, using a *tag*
between colons and preceding the object. For example, `:X:3` is a tagged
integer, where the tag is `X` and the object is `3`.

When displayed on the stack, tags are shown without the leading colon for
readability. For example, the object above shows as `X:3` on the stack.

## ‚ÜíTag

Apply a tag to an object. The tag is in level 1 as text or name. The object to
be tagged is in level 2. For example, `"Hello" 1 ‚ÜíTag` results in `:Hello:1`.
Like on the HP calculators, it is possible to next tags.

## Tag‚Üí

Expand a tagged object in level 1 into its object and tag. The object will be in
level 2, the tag will be in level 1 as a text object.

For example, `:Hello:1 Tag‚Üí` results in `"Hello"` in level 1 and `1` in level 2.

## DeleteTag

Remove a tag from an object. For example, `:Hello:1 DeleteTag` results in `1`.
If there is no tag, the object is returned as is.
# Operations on text

Return the Unicode codepoint of the first character in the text, or `-1` if the
text is empty. `"Hello" NUM` returns `72`.

## Text‚ÜíCode

Return a list of the Unicode codepoints for all codepoints in the given text.
`"Hello" Text‚ÜíCode` returns `{ 72 101 108 108 111 }`.


## Code‚ÜíText

Build a text out of a Unicode codepoint. The argument can be either a single
numerical value or a list of numerical values. A negative numerical value
produces an empty text. `{ 87 111 114 -22 108 100 }` returns `"World"`, the
value `-22` producing no character. `42 CHR` returns `"*"`, and `34 CHR` returns
`""""`, which is a 1-character text containing an ASCII quote `"`.

# Analytic functions

In mathematics, an analytic function is a function that is locally given by a
convergent power series. There exist both real analytic functions and complex
analytic functions. Functions of each type are infinitely differentiable, but
complex analytic functions exhibit properties that do not generally hold for
real analytic functions.

DB48X analytic functions generally have a symbolic differentiation form.
Many of them also have a symbolic primitive for symbolic integration.

# Transcendental functions

## sin

[Analytic function](#analytic-functions) returning the sine of the argument.

For real arguments, the current angle mode determines the number‚Äôs units, unless
angular units are specified. If the argument for `sin` is a unit object, then
the specified angular unit overrides the angle mode to determine the result.

For complex arguments, the computation is always done considering that the real
part is in radians.

`z` ‚ñ∂ *sin* `z`

`x_angleunit` ‚ñ∂ *sin* `x_angleunit`

`symbexpr` ‚ñ∂ `sin symbexpr`

## cos

[Analytic function](#analytic-functions) returning the cosine of the argument

For real arguments, the current angle mode determines the number‚Äôs units, unless
angular units are specified. If the argument for `cos` is a unit object, then
the specified angular unit overrides the angle mode to determine the result.

`z` ‚ñ∂ *cos* `z`

`x_angleunit` ‚ñ∂ *cos* `x_angleunit`

`symbexpr` ‚ñ∂ `cos symbexpr`


## tan

[Analytic function](#analytic-functions) returning the tangent of the argument

For real arguments, the current angle mode determines the number‚Äôs units, unless
angular units are specified. If the argument for `tan` is a unit object, then
the specified angular unit overrides the angle mode to determine the result.

For a real argument that is an odd-integer multiple of 90 degrees, an
[infinite result](#infinite-result) is generated.

Convert value from one unit to another. This convert the values in the second level of the stack to the unit of the object in the first level of the stack. Only the unit in the first level of the stack is being considered, the actual value is ignored. For example:

`3_km` `2_m` ‚ñ∂ `3000_m`



## FactorUnit

Factor the unit in level 1 from the unit expression of the level 2 unit object.

`1_W` `1_N` ‚ñ∂ `1_N*m/s`


## ‚ÜíUnit

Creates a unit object from a real number and the unit part of a unit object.
`‚ÜíUnit` adds units to a number, combining the number and the unit part of a
unit object. The numerical part of the unit object is ignored.

`‚ÜíUnit` is the reverse of `Unit‚Üí` or of `Obj‚Üí` applied to a unit object.

```rpl
@ Will be 3000_km
3000 2_km ‚ÜíUnit
```

## UnitsSIPrefixCycle

Sets a prefix cycle for SI units when using the `Cycle` key (_EEX_ or _√ó10‚Åø_,
next to _O_) on the command-line to cycle through SI prefixes. The cycle is
specified as a text string containing all the desired prefixes, in the order in
which they should appear. This preference is stored in the `UnitsSIPrefixCycle`
variable in the current directory.

For example, after executing `"cmkŒº" UnitsSIPrefixCycle`, typing _1_ ___ _m_ __
_√ó10‚Åø_ will show `1_cm` on the command line. Hitting _√ó10‚Åø_ again will change
that command line to `1_mm`, and again to `1_km`.

# UserModeMenu

Like most HP calculators, DB48X features a "user mode", where the keyboard can
be redefined in whole or in part. This lets you customize the keyboard for
specific tasks, for example if the default key bindings are not optimal for a
specific situation.

User mode is activated using üü® _2_ (`ToggleUserMode`).
When `UserModeOnce` is selected, the first press enables user mode for one key
only, and a second press locks user mode.
When `UserModeLock` is selected, each use toggles user mode on or off.

## KeyMap

Key assignments on DB48x are not global, unlike what happens with `ASN` on HP
claculators. Instead, assignments are stored in a special variable (really a
directory containing numbered variables) called `KeyMap`. This approach makes it
possible to have per-directory key assignments, and to use normal tools such as
`Store` and `Recall` to manipulate key assignments.

If a `KeyMap` is present in the current directory, it overrides assignments
while you are in that directory. However, key assignments from the enclosing
directories are still considered when they are not overriden. In other words,
key assignments are a hierarchy. When no key assignment is found in any of the
`KeyMap` variables in any of the enclosing directories, then the default key
binding for that key applies.

## Key positions

Like on HP calculators, key assignments are specified using a key position.
The key position is given in the form `rc.ph`, where `r` is a row number, `c` is
a column number, `p` is a shift plane and `h` indicates if we held the key.
The shift plane has the following values, where `7`, `8` and `9` are DB48X
extensions.

* `0`: Unshifted (only used on input, values returned use `1`)
* `1`: Unshifted
* `2`: Left shift
* `3`: Right shift
* `4`: Uppercase alpha
* `5`: Uppercase alpha left shift
* `6`: Uppercase alpha right shift
* `7`: Lowercase alpha
* `8`: Lowercase alpha left shift
* `9`: Lowercase alpha right shift

For example, the key for `SIN` is `34.1`, the key for the right-shifted `MAT`
menu above the `9` key is `54.3`, and the key for `Z` in Alpha mode is `74.4`.


## Behaviour of assigned object

When using the key in user mode, the associated object is evaluated.
However, when editing, the associated object is inserted into the command
line. This is different from HP calculators, which do nothing in that case.

If the associated object is a text, then the text is always inserted as is into
the text editor. In that case, if the text contains a TAB character (`9 CHR`),
then the cursor will automatically be positioned at that location.

## AssignKey

The `ASN` command defines the behaviour of a given key in user mode.
It takes two arguments, an object and a [key position](#key-position).
The assignment is placed in the `KeyMap` variable for the current directory.

To clear an assignment, assign `StandardKey` to a given key.

For example, to assign the `asn` command to the key on the third row and fourth column (which is _sin_ by default), use the following:
```rpl
'ASN' 34 ASN
```

To restore the standard key assignment for that same key, use the following:
```rpl
'StandardKey' 34 ASN
```

## StoreKeys

Defines multiple keys on the user keyboard by assigning objects to specified
keys. The argument is a list where the object to assign is followed by the
position, using the same format as `ASN`.

For example, to assign Greek letters to the shifted keys `A` through `F` when in
alpha mode, use the following code:
```rpl
{ "Œ±" 21.5 "Œ≤" 22.5 "Œ≥" 23.5 "Œ¥" 24.5 "Œµ" 25.5 "œÜ" 26.5 }
STOKEYS
```

## RecallKeys

Recall the current user key assignment in the current directory.

With the key assignments given in the example for `StoreKeys`, the output will
match the input list we were given.

```rpl
RCLKEYS
@ Expecting { "Œ±" 21.5 "Œ≤" 22.5 "Œ≥" 23.5 "Œ¥" 24.5 "Œµ" 25.5 "œÜ" 26.5 }
```

This will merge the key assignments of the current directory and all enclosing
directories, which will appear at end of the list. In that case, the assignments
for enclosing directories will appear after a sequence like `1` `UpDir`, `2`
`UpDir`, and so on. Keys definitions that follow such a sequence are ignored by
`StoreKeys`, which only modifies the keymap for the current directory.

## DeleteKeys

Delete key assignments.

If the argument is a specific key position, then the assignment for that key
position is removed. For example, the following code will remove the assignment
for key `E` that was specified earlier:

```rpl
25.5 DELKEYS
```

If the argument is a list, then all the positions given in the list will be
deleted. For example, to remove assignmens for keys `A`, `B` and `F` assigned
by the earlier example, you can use:

```rpl
{ 21.5 22.5 26.5 } DELKEYS
```

If the argument is `0`, then all assignments in the current directory are
removed. For example, to remove the assignments given above, use:

```rpl
0 DELKEYS
```


## StandardKey

The `StandardKey` is given as an argument to `AssignKey` or `StoreKeys` to erase
a specific key assignment.


## UserMode

Enables user mode. The opposite setting is `UserModeOff`.

## UserModeOff

Disable user mode. The opposite setting is `UserMode`.

## ToggleUserMode

Toggle `UserMode` between on and off states. When `UserModeLock` is not set,
then a first call to `ToggleUserMode` will select user mode for a single
operation, and the second call will select user mode until it is disabled.

`ToggleUserMode` is bound to üü® _2_ by default.

## UserModeLock

Lock user mode when using `ToggleUserMode`, meaning that user mode will not
automatically be disabled after the first operation. The opposite setting is
`UserModeOnce`.

## UserModeOnce

Enable temporary user mode, where the first activation of `ToggleUserMode` only
enables user mode for a single operation. The oppsite setting is `UserModeLock`.
